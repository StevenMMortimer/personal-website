## Overview

The {salesforcer} package is the R implementation of the Salesforce platform APIs. 
I created the package to build upon the functionality provided in the {RForcecom} 
package by including calls from more APIs (REST, SOAP, Bulk, and Metadata) along with 
following more tidy data principles when wrangling data from the APIs.

## Features

This R package supports a variety of Salesforce API operations and more will be added. 
Package features include:

  * OAuth 2.0 (Single Sign On) and Basic (Username-Password) Authentication 
  methods (`sf_auth()`)
  * CRUD (Create, Retrieve, Update, Delete) methods for records using the SOAP, 
  REST, and Bulk APIs 
  * Query records via the SOAP, REST, Bulk 1.0, and Bulk 2.0 APIs using `sf_query()`
  * Manage and execute reports and dashboards with:  
    * `sf_list_reports()`, `sf_create_report()`, `sf_run_report()`, and more
  * Retrieve and modify metadata (Custom Objects, Fields, etc.) using the Metadata 
  API with:  
    * `sf_describe_objects()`, `sf_create_metadata()`, `sf_update_metadata()`, and more
  * Utilize backwards compatible functions for the {RForcecom} package, such as: 
    * `rforcecom.login()`, `rforcecom.getObjectDescription()`, `rforcecom.query()`, 
    `rforcecom.create()`
  * Basic utility calls (`sf_user_info()`, `sf_server_timestamp()`, `sf_list_objects()`)
  * Functions to assist with master data management (MDM) or data integrity of 
  records by finding duplicates (`sf_find_duplicates()`, `sf_find_duplicates_by_id()`), 
  merging records (`sf_merge()`), and converting leads (`sf_convert_lead()`)
  * Recover (`sf_undelete()`) or delete from the Recycle Bin (`sf_empty_recycle_bin()`) 
  and list ids of records deleted (`sf_get_deleted()`) or updated (`sf_get_updated()`) 
  within a specific timeframe
  * Passing API call control parameters such as, "All or None", "Duplicate Rule", 
  "Assignment Rule" execution and many more!

## Quickstart Guide

### Install salesforcer Library

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# install the current version from CRAN
install.packages("salesforcer")

# or get the development version on GitHub
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("StevenMMortimer/salesforcer")
```

### Authentication

The {salesforcer} package provides two methods to authenticate:  

  1. OAuth 2.0
  2. Basic Username-Password with Security Token

It is recommended to use OAuth 2.0 so that passwords do not have to be shared or 
embedded within scripts. User credentials will be stored in locally cached file 
entitled ".httr-oauth-salesforcer" in the current working directory. These credentials 
will be passed to the API for each call and refreshed if necessary.

```{r auth, include = FALSE}
suppressWarnings(suppressMessages(library(tidyverse)))
library(salesforcer)
username <- Sys.getenv("SALESFORCER_USERNAME")
password <- Sys.getenv("SALESFORCER_PASSWORD")
security_token <- Sys.getenv("SALESFORCER_SECURITY_TOKEN")

sf_auth(username = username,
        password = password,
        security_token = security_token)

session <- RForcecom::rforcecom.login(username, 
                                      paste0(password, security_token), 
                                      apiVersion = getOption("salesforcer.api_version"))
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(salesforcer)

# Using OAuth 2.0 authentication
sf_auth()

# Using Basic Username-Password authentication
sf_auth(username = "test@gmail.com", 
        password = "{PASSWORD_HERE}",
        security_token = "{SECURITY_TOKEN_HERE}")
```

### Support for Multiple APIs

The {salesforcer} package is unique in that it provides a common interface to 
all of the REST, SOAP, and Bulk APIs. If you would like to create a set of records, 
then you would use the same R function, `sf_create()`, in the same way and just 
change the function argument called `api_type`.

```{r multiple-api-types}
# create a dataset of 2 new contacts to create
n <- 2
new_contacts <- tibble(FirstName = rep("Test", n),
                       LastName = paste0("Contact-Create-", 1:n))

# using the REST API
rest_records <- sf_create(new_contacts, object_name="Contact", api_type="REST")
rest_records

# using the REST API
soap_records <- sf_create(new_contacts, object_name="Contact", api_type="SOAP")
soap_records

# using the Bulk 1.0 API
bulk_records <- sf_create(new_contacts, object_name="Contact", api_type="Bulk 1.0")
bulk_records
```

```{r cleanup-multiple-apis, include = FALSE}
deleted_records <- sf_delete(rest_records$id)
deleted_records <- sf_delete(soap_records$id)
deleted_records <- sf_delete(bulk_records$Id)
```

This form is especially useful when switching between the REST and Bulk APIs where 
if you start dealing with larger and larger datasets, then you can switch code 
easily to the Bulk API. **Note**: The Bulk 2.0 API does NOT guarantee the order of 
the data submitted is preserved in the output that is returned. This means that you 
must join on other data columns to match up the IDs that are returned in the output with the 
data you submitted. For this reason, Bulk 2.0 may not be a good solution for creating, 
updating, or upserting records where you need to keep track of the created IDs. 
The Bulk 2.0 API would be fine for deleting records where you only need to know 
which IDs were successfully deleted.

### Support for Metadata

The {salesforcer} package also supports the creating, editing, and deleting of 
Salesforce metadata. Metadata refers to the configuration of "objects" within Salesforce. 
An object could be a standard or new type of record. For example, the Metadata API can 
configuring which fields are captured on an Account or whether they should be displayed on the page. 
Even more complex configurations, such as, workflows and triggers can be configured 
using the Metadata API. The support for the Metadata API in {salesforcer} is experimental, 
so please use at your own risk and consult the appropriate Salesforce resources 
when trying to use. One common use case for the Metadata API 
is retrieving information about an object (fields, permissions, etc.). You can use 
the `sf_read_metadata()` function to return a list of objects and their metadata. 
In the example below we retrieve the metadata for the Account and Contact objects. 
Note that the `metadata_type` argument is "CustomObject". Standard Objects are an 
implementation of CustomObjects, so they are returned using that metadata type.

```{r metadata-read}
read_obj_result <- sf_read_metadata(metadata_type='CustomObject',
                                    object_names=c('Account', 'Contact'))
read_obj_result[[1]][c('fullName', 'label', 'sharingModel', 'enableHistory')]
first_two_fields_idx <- head(which(names(read_obj_result[[1]]) == 'fields'), 2)
# show the first two returned fields of the Account object
read_obj_result[[1]][first_two_fields_idx]
```

The data is returned as a list because object definitions are highly nested representations. 
You may notice that we are missing some really specific details, such as, the picklist 
values of a field with type "Picklist". You can get that information using 
`sf_describe_object_fields()`. Here is an example using `sf_describe_object_fields()` 
where we get a `tbl_df` with one row for each field on the Account object: 

```{r soap-describe-object-fields}
acct_fields <- sf_describe_object_fields('Account')
acct_fields %>% select(name, label, length, soapType, type)
# show the picklist selection options for the Account Type field
acct_fields %>% 
  filter(label == "Account Type") %>% 
  .$picklistValues
```

### Extension of the RForcecom Package

The {salesforcer} package can be seen as an extension of the popular {RForcecom} 
package that originally introduced R users to the Salesforce APIs. However, there are 
a few key differences. First, {salesforcer} supports more APIs. It allows for the same 
methods to utilize either the REST or SOAP APIs. It also supports the newer version of the 
Bulk API called "Bulk 2.0" and a limited set of functionality from the Metadata API. 
There are future plans to incorporate the Reporting and Analytics APIs. Second, 
{salesforcer} makes it easier to submit multiple records at once by supplying a 
`data.frame` instead of a named vector.

```{r not-looping-to-create, warning=FALSE}
n <- 2
new_contacts <- tibble(FirstName = rep("Test", n),
                       LastName = paste0("Contact-Create-", 1:n))

# the RForcecom way
rforcecom_results <- NULL
for(i in 1:nrow(new_contacts)){
  temp <- RForcecom::rforcecom.create(session, 
                                      objectName = "Contact", 
                                      fields = unlist(slice(new_contacts,i)))
  rforcecom_results <- bind_rows(rforcecom_results, temp)
}
rforcecom_results

# the salesforcer way
salesforcer_results <- salesforcer::sf_create(new_contacts, object_name="Contact")
salesforcer_results
```

```{r cleanup-rforcecom, include = FALSE}
deleted_records <- sf_delete(rforcecom_results$id)
deleted_records <- sf_delete(salesforcer_results$id)
```

Finally, the package is meant to adhere to principles outlined by the **tidyverse** 
package. Function names are snake case and data is returned as `tbl_df` objects. 
Do not worry if you are fully utilizing the {RForcecom} package. Many of those 
functions are included in the {salesforcer} package so you can drop the {RForcecom} 
dependency but not have to change all of your code at once.

## Check out the Tests

The {salesforcer} package has quite a bit of unit test coverage to track any code changes 
and ensure package reliabilty. These tests are an excellent source of examples because 
they cover most all cases of utilizing the package functions. 

For example, if you are not sure on how to upsert records using the Bulk API just 
check out the tests at <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/StevenMMortimer/salesforcer/blob/master/tests/testthat/test-bulk.R">https://github.com/StevenMMortimer/salesforcer/blob/master/tests/testthat/test-bulk.R</a>.

The `test-bulk.R` script walks through a process of creating, searching, querying, 
updating, upserting, and deleting the same set of records, so it is a concise set 
of code for manipulating records via the Bulk API. Similar test scripts exist for the 
REST and SOAP APIs as well.

## Support

This project was made with love and coffee. Studies show that I write R code 3x faster 
after drinking one cup coffee and that productivity scales linearly. Imagine what 
I could accomplish if you bought me 10 cups of coffee...

Thank you for your support!
