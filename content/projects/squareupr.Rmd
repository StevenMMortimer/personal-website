## Overview

The **squareupr** package is the R implementation of the <a target="_blank" href="UPDATE THIS LINKE WITH THE REAL ONE">Square APIs</a> 
(Connect v1 & v2). I created the package while analyzing customer data from Square and 
found that a package was necessary to make my code more efficient and reproducible. 
The functions in the package are simple wrappers built using the **httr** package 
that reach out to the various Square API endpoints. There are also a few convenience 
functions that transform data once receiving it from the APIs.

## Features

The package currently supports the following API operations: 

  * OAuth 2.0 (Single sign-on) and Personal Access Token Authentication methods (`sq_auth()`)
  * v2 Locations Endpoint (`sq_list_locations()`, `sq_get_location()`)
  * v2 Transactions Endpoint (`sq_list_transactions()`, `sq_get_transaction()`)
  * v2 Customers Endpoint - CRUD (Create, Retrieve, Update, Delete) methods for customers with: 
    * `sq_list_customers()`, `sq_get_customer()`, `sq_create_customer()`, `sq_update_customer()`, `sq_delete_customer()`
  * v1 Payments Endpoint (`sq_list_payments()`, `sq_get_payment()`)
  * v1 Items Endpoint - CRUD (Create, Retrieve, Update, Delete) methods for items with: 
    * `sq_list_items()`, `sq_get_item()`, `sq_create_item()`, `sq_update_item()`, `sq_delete_item()`

## Quickstart Guide

### Install squareupr Library

```{r eval=FALSE}
# This package is experimental and not available on CRAN. 
# You can install directly from GitHub using the devtools package
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("StevenMMortimer/squareupr")
```

### Authentication

First, load the **squareupr** package and authenticate. There are two ways to authenticate:  

  1. Personal Access Token
  2. OAuth 2.0

```{r auth, include = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(squareupr)
settings <- readRDS(here::here("blogdown", "projects", "squareupr_test_settings.rds"))
suppressMessages(sq_auth(personal_access_token = settings$personal_access_token, 
                         verbose = FALSE))
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(squareupr)

# Using Personal Access Token (PAT)
sq_auth(personal_access_token = "sq-Th1s1sMyPers0nalAcessT0ken")

# Using OAuth 2.0 authentication
sq_auth()
```

NOTE: Before using OAuth 2.0 authentication it is necessary that you set up your 
own Connected App in the Square dashboard. An App ID and App Secret will be 
provided, then you will be able to plug into your script like so:

```{r other-params, eval=FALSE}
options(squareupr.app_id = "sq0-99-thisisatest99connected33app22id")
options(squareupr.app_secret = "sq0-Th1s1sMyAppS3cr3t")
sq_auth()
```

OAuth 2.0 credentials will be cached locally in a file entitled `".httr-oauth-squareupr"` 
in the current working directory so that a new token is not needed each session.

### Determining Business Locations

The first step, after authenticating, is determining the unique IDs associated with 
each of your Square business locations. The API data is often organized or pulled 
by location, so it is important to know which ID is associated with each location you 
may have, even if you only have one location. In the **squareupr** packge you can 
use the `sq_list_locations()` function to retrieve the details of each location. 
The ID to take note of is listed in the `ID` column shown in the data below.

```{r locations}
# list all locations
our_locations <- sq_list_locations()
our_locations$name <- "{HIDDEN}"
our_locations$phone_number <- "{HIDDEN}"
our_locations %>% 
  select(id, name, address, phone_number, status)
```

### Pulling Transactions

Transactions are organized by location. With with the `sq_list_transactions()` 
function you can provide the location and timeframe to search. The function defaults 
to pulling transactions from the previous day using `Sys.Date() - 1` if no dates are 
specified.

```{r transactions-by-location}
# list all locations
our_locations <- sq_list_locations()
our_transactions <- sq_list_transactions(location = our_locations$id[2], 
                                         begin_time = as.Date('2018-05-11'), 
                                         end_time = as.Date('2018-05-12'))
our_transactions
```

At first glance there does not appear to be very much detail on the transaction record. 
However, the `tender` field represents a method of payment used in a Square transaction 
so it contains information regarding the amount of money paid in total, in Square fees, 
and tip. The `tender` field even contains information regarding the `customer_id` and 
credit card information.

### Helper Functions

In Square, customers can be assigned to groups. Those groups can be helpful for studies 
on a particular set of customers. The **squareupr** package has a convenience function
called `sq_extract_cust_groups()` that will take data retrieved from the Customer 
API endpoint and extract the group membership of each customer into a `tbl_df` that 
is one row per customer group membership (i.e. customers may be repeated in rows 
if they belong to more than one group). Note: Square may create some loyalty and churn 
risk groups without you having to manually create them.

```{r customers}
# list all customers
our_customers <- sq_list_customers()
our_customers$given_name <- "{HIDDEN}"
our_customers$family_name <- "{HIDDEN}"
our_customers %>% select(id, given_name, family_name, preferences, groups)

# show the groups that each customer belongs to
# filter to the groups designated automatically by Square
sq_extract_cust_groups(our_customers) %>%
  filter(grepl("^CQ689YH4KCJMY", groups.id))
```

## Check out the Tests

The **squareupr** package has quite a bit of unit test coverage to track any 
changes made between newly released versions of the Square APIs. These tests are 
great source of examples for how to interect with the API. The tests are available

## Support

This project was made with love and coffee. Studies show that I write R code 3x faster 
after drinking one cup coffee and that productivity scales linearly. Imagine what 
I could accomplish if you bought me 10 cups of coffee...

Thank you for your support!
