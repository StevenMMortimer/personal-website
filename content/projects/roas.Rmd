## Overview

The **roas** package is the R implementation of the Open Ad Stream (OAS) API. 
I created the package because very few tools and documentation exist for the OAS API.

## Features

Anything that the OAS API supports, you can do with this R package!

 - List, Create, Copy, and Update operations on OAS objects
 - Forecasting & Inventory Management Reports
 - Precanned Reports (By Site, Advertiser, Campaign, and many more)
 
## Functions

The functions are named to mimic each OAS request action ('Add', 'List', 'Update', 
'Delete', 'Read', 'Copy', 'Upload', 'Run Live', 'Reports', 'Inventory'), but 
many of these actions are reserved words, so the functions are named {oas_action}(). 
For example, running the 'List' action is done with the function oas_list().

## How to Get Started

### Install roas Library

```{r eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("ReportMort/roas")
```

### Setup and Authenticate

The only required authentication parameters are the Account, Username, and Password 
for the OAS instance you'd like to access. There is another option if you have a 
different URL endpoint.

```{r load-package, eval=FALSE}
library(roas)
options(stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# setting authentication parameters
options(roas.account = "myaccountname")
options(roas.username = "myusername")
options(roas.password = "mypassword")

# setting a new endpoint to use for requests
# only required if you need to
options(roas.url_endpoint = "https://openadstream11.247realmedia.com/oasapi/OaxApi")
```

### Authenticate with oas_build_credentials()

Build credentials for authorization and pass them into subsequent request function 
calls. The credentials can be reused as many times as needed.

``` r
my_credentials <- oas_build_credentials('myaccount', 
                                        'myusername', 
                                        'mypassword')
```

### Listing OAS Objects

``` r
# list all of the sites in my account
list_my_sites <- oas_list(credentials = my_credentials, 
                          request_type = 'Site')
```

Here is a more complicated list example that will list all pages from the "mySite" 
domain and have a URL containing "001", but they must be from the section matching 
the wildcard "Ar%ves" and created after Dec. 31st, 2016 and modified after Jan. 
31st, 2017. This example is very specific, but we're using this example to show 
how you can specify multiple difference criteria all at once to narrow down your 
resultset.

``` r
my_criteria <- list(newXMLNode("Domain", "mySite"), 
                    newXMLNode("Url", "001"), 
                    newXMLNode("SectionId", "Ar%ves"), 
                    newXMLNode("WhenCreated", 
                               attrs = c(condition = "GT"), 
                               '2016-12-31'), 
                    newXMLNode("WhenModified", 
                               attrs = c(condition = "GT"), 
                               '2017-01-31')
                    ) 
list_w_criteria <- oas_list(credentials = my_credentials, 
                            request_type = 'Page',
                            search_criteria = my_criteria)
```

The OAS system also contains codes for enumerated fields. For example, there is a 
finite list of Designated Market Areas (DMAs) that your campaigns can target. Each 
DMA has a code that corresponds to a longer, more descriptive name. The campaigns 
only show the code, so you'll need this list of DMA codes to figure out more 
descriptive names of the targeting that your campaign is implementing.

```r
dma_codes <- oas_list_code(credentials = my_credentials, 
                           code_type = 'DMA')
```

### Reading an OAS Object

OAS objects are uniquely identified by their Id. Typically, you use the `oas_list()` 
function to pull down a list and figure out the Ids of objects you'd like to read. 
Once you've identified those individual objects you can use the `oas_read()` function to 
retrieve all available fields the object. In the examples below you can see how 
we pull back the details on a site with the Id: "www.mysite.com" and we also pull back 
details on a campaign with the Id: "one_campaign_id". 

``` r
# details for "www.mysite.com"
site_details <- oas_read(credentials = my_credentials, 
                         request_type ='Site', 
                         id = 'www.mysite.com')
                             
# details for "one_campaign_id"                             
campaign_details <- oas_read(credentials = my_credentials, 
                             request_type = 'Campaign', 
                             id = 'one_campaign_id')
```

### Running Reports

The OAS API supports over **800** different template reports. These reports cover 
a wide range of things, such as, Campaign Delivery, Account Revenue, and many more. 
You _must_ specify the `report_type`, `report_name`, and a date range. You can view 
all the different report types and names by running `data(available_reports)`. Simply 
pick an item from the list and plug its type and name into the `oas_report()` function.

``` r
data(available_reports)

# List out all the Campaign Delivery reports
available_reports[available_reports$report_type == 'Campaign Delivery', ]

# Retrieve a template executive summary report on campaign delivery
campaign_delivery <- oas_report(credentials = my_credentials, 
                                report_type = 'Campaign Delivery',
                                report_name = 'Executive Summary',
                                start_date = '2016-01-01', 
                                end_date = '2016-12-31')
```

### Getting Inventory Forecasts

The OAS API supports inventory checking on various levels: Basic, Search, Geography. 
For example, if you need to see the available inventory for a particular search keyword, then 
you can do that by using the function `oas_search_inventory()`. If you need to see 
the available inventory for a particular geography, then use `oas_geo_inventory()`. Note, 
these functions may take awhile to run and may only support simplistic pulls that may need 
to be combined or averaged to come up with a reasonable estimate of available inventory. These 
issues are related to how the OAS API functions and not how this package operates. This package 
is only a wrapper to more easily retrieve the data from OAS. This is _no_ intermediate logic.

``` r
# Retrieve an inventory forecast for all sites
# Note that start and end dates must be greater than or equal to 
# Sys.Date() otherwise forecast reports will return a 0 row data.frame
overview <- oas_basic_inventory(credentials = my_credentials, 
                                report_type = 'Overview', 
                                report_name = 'All Sites Forecast',
                                start_date = '2020-01-01', 
                                end_date = '2020-12-31')

# Retrieve booked inventory based on two keywords (Kw1, Kw2) 
# for a particular campaign on a site
booked <- oas_search_inventory(credentials = my_credentials, 
                               report_type = 'KeywordBooked', 
                               report_name = 'Campaign Targets',
                               keywords = 'Kw1,Kw2',
                               campaign_id = 'Test_Campaign',
                               site_domain = 'www.mysite.com',
                               start_date = '2020-01-01', 
                               end_date = '2020-12-31')
```

## Support

This project was made with love and coffee. Studies show that I write R code 3x faster 
after drinking one cup coffee and that productivity scales linearly. Imagine what 
I could accomplish if you bought me 10 cups of coffee...

Thank you for your support!
