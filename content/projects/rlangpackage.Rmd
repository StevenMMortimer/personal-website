One R Package a Day (<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/RLangPackage">@RLangPackage</a> 
on Twitter) is a Python-based Twitter bot deployed and scheduled to run on Heroku's 
Free Tier. The purpose of the Twitter account is to feature the diversity of 
packages that R has to offer, especially the thousands of great packages waiting 
to be discovered by the casual R user. This project was created using a host of 
resources which are listed on my blog <a target="_blank" href="/one-r-package-a-day">post</a> 
introducing the account to the world.

When writing another blog post I was struck by how many R packages there are (over 
12,600 at the time of this writing). Immediately my mind thought as to how many 
that would be if you downloaded one package a day. The answer is 34+ years. I'm not sure I 
can religiously download one a day, but I could make a bot to inspire others to 
download a package a day. The basic pseudocode of the bot's algorithm is the following: 

 1. Load Twitter credentials from file
 2. Read @RLangPackage's tweets to parse out which packages it has already tweeted about
 3. Read a list of R packages with their metadata
 4. "Anti join" the two lists so that we don't tweet out a package twice
 5. Filter down to mildly popular packages based on CRAN downloads and GitHub Star counts
 6. Randomly select one row of the data (one package)
 7. Form the tweet based on the package name, description, and GitHub URL
 8. Send it out!

I already had compiled a list of R packages with their name, description, URL, CRAN 
download count, and GitHub star count. By using this data, and updating it regularly, 
the script can pick from a menu of great R packages. To prevent the bot from tweeting 
about the same package over and over again, I randomly select rows from the list of 
packages after having scraped the account's tweets and ensuring it hadn't tweeted about 
the package before.

Heroku makes it a breeze to deploy this type of script and host it for free. Simply 
create an account and then create a Python app. I decided to link my GitHub repository 
with the app so that any code changes that are pushed to GitHub will trigger a new 
deployment on Heroku's servers.

I found this easier that using Heroku CLI which would require me to push new changes 
myself. In addition, you will need to configure your app's environment by including 
a `requirements.txt` file and adding config vars for the Twitter credentials. The 
`requirements.txt` file is just a list of Python libraries that your app needs in 
order to run. In this case it is **python-dotenv**, **pandas**, and **twitterAPI**. 
These libraries will be installed on the virtual server when the script is executed. 
Using config vars in Heroku is important so that the Twitter credentials will work 
in the same way locally as they do on Heroku's servers. I'm hosting the project's 
code on GitHub so I didn't want to openly put my Twitter credentials in the script, 
so I have a `.env` file locally on my computer. On Heroku I have set up the config 
vars with the same key value pairs. This way whenever the script runs it can read 
these values from the `.env` file locally or the app's environment when it runs on 
Heroku. I do recommend downloading the Heroku CLI just to be able to run and check 
your script. I could trigger the script using the command: 

```
heroku run -a YOUR-APP-NAME python YOUR-SCRIPT-NAME.py
```

and check the logs using the command: 

```
heroku logs -a YOUR-APP-NAME --tail
```

Finally, the Twitter bot wouldn't be very robotic if it didn't tweet out everyday 
on its own. I used the Heroku Scheduler to automate the execution of the script 
each day. Heroku Scheduler has a really easy to use dashboard where you can add a 
job to execute the Python script at a set time.
