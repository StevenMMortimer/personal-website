### Simple Automation
If you would like to automate R scripts, one method is to use the cron daemon already packaged on Unix-like servers. Let's say you have script in your home directory called `random.R` 
and you would like to schedule it to run at 5:30pm every day. On the server you will 
need to edit the crontab and add the following line: 

```
30 17 * * * Rscript /home/my-user/random.R
```

Note: You can edit the of the crontab by typing 

1. `crontab -e`
2. Press `i` to enter insert mode
3. Paste your new entry in the file
4. Press CTRL+C to exit insert mode
5. Save and quit by typing `:wq`

### Adding Error Emailing
It is exciting to have a routine part of your work automated, but you probably 
want to monitor your script and the results its creating. Cron has a built-in 
feature that can send an email whenever an scheduled script errors out. Just add 
your email address to the `MAILTO` option. If you want to include multiple emails, 
then separate them with a semicolon.

Now you may be tempted to simply add your email address and call it a day, but you might notice 
that R starts flooding your inbox with cron emails even for successful runs of your 
script. If you prefer to only receive emails when your script errors out, then you 
have to short circuit how cron identifies R script errors. Below I’ll outline how 
to setup cron to only email on real R script errors.

Cron determines whether to send an email based on the “exit code” of the script 
that runs. An exit code is a number emitted at the end of the script indicating 
a status of whether not an error occurred during the execution of the script. 
However, R emits exit codes a little differently than most scripting languages. 
In R any messages are converted to an exit code 1 (signaling an error), so it is 
possible to have a script that ran successfully, but signals an error occurred 
in running the script. There’s not a great reason for this behavior (see link). 
Upon realizing that messages are errors in disguise, it makes more sense to me 
why they’re displayed in red in the R console. [add picture]. Fortunately, a 
clever use of I/O redirection (similar to dplyr piping), can roll message-induced 
error codes into less benign forms so that an email is not triggered when messages 
were printed, but your script really didn’t error out. The way to do this is modify 
the command listed in your crontab file. Instead of just including `Rscript /home/my-user/random.R`, 
you should include:

```
Rscript /home/my-user/random.R > temp.log 2>&1 || cat temp.log
```

The `>` command will redirect the error feed (captured by “2”) and roll it into 
the standard output (stdout) feed (captured by “1”) and push them into temp.log. 
The `||` command checks whether the script had a non-zero exit status. If so, 
then it will run the `cat` command and print everything to the console and trigger 
an error email from cron.

### Adding Script Logging
Also, you might want to log the script execution, so how do you do that as well? 
You just need to continue redirecting output as you desire. One way is having a 
crontab entry like this:

```
Rscript /home/my-user/random.R > temp.log 2>&1 || cat temp.log && cat temp.log >> persistent.log && rm temp.log
```

This method will still roll error messages into the standard feed and only trigger 
the email if the script didn’t finish, but then it will push everything into a 
persistent log that will keep a record of every run that you scripts do. This way 
you can get the error emails and keep a complete log of everything you script did 
if you’re looking to do a more complete review or post-mortem. 

That's it. Now that you're aware of the format, then you can copy/paste it for 
every other script that you schedule. You really don't need to understand all of the details, 
just the last snippet of code in this post, but I'd recommend browsing online to understand 
more about cron and I/O redirection. Also, I’ve outlined this logic in a Stack Overflow 
response at https://stackoverflow.com/a/34442846/5258043.
