```{r setup, include = FALSE, message = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>",
  echo = TRUE,
  cache = TRUE,
  fig.align = "center"
)
```

I never thought too much about RStudio addins, but I saw a few cool examples (
<a href="https://github.com/jennybc/jadd" target="_blank">jadd</a>, 
<a href="https://github.com/daattali/colourpicker" target="_blank">colorpicker</a>, and 
<a href="https://github.com/daattali/addinslist" target="_blank">addinslist</a>) and 
decided to take a closer look. After a little research, it seemed easier than I thought. 
It was easier because RStudio provided some excellent 
<a href="https://rstudio.github.io/rstudioaddins" target="_blank">documentation on addins</a> 
and it turns out that if you can write R code, then you can write an RStudio addin.

## My Idea

Around the time I was looking at addins, I started taking advantage of a little
RStudio trick to navigate long scripts. If you create comments that are a pound sign and 
end with at least 4 dashes (`# Comment ----`), then they will automatically be 
organized and appear in an organizational perspective at the bottom left of the Source pane.

I'll take any extra organizational help I can get so I started annotating my code 
with comments like these to break it up. Then the idea hit me to create an Addin 
and link a keyboard shortcut to it so I can format comments quickly to this standard.

## The Implementation

The logic is written in R code and the `rstudioapi` package is used so that your 
code can interact with RStudio. The R code can be complex or really simple (see 
the RStudio example on <a href="https://rstudio.github.io/rstudioaddins/#addin-basics" target="_blank">Addin basics</a>). 
However, you must structure your project with certain metadata, like an R package, that 
will allow RStudio to automatically discover and register these addins when the 
addin is installed.

The R code should be documented using the `roxygen2` style. Here is the small 
bit of regex that powers most of my sectioncomment addin.

```{r example, eval=FALSE}
#' Function to create the padded comment
#' 
#' This function is the logic that runs to reformat
#' the comment as a section break
#' 
#' @usage comment_styler(x, doc_mode=FALSE, l = 80)
#' @importFrom stringr str_pad
#' @param x a string to format
#' @param doc_mode a logical indicating only to convert 
#' lines starting with at least a double hash sign
#' @param l an integer indicating length to pad
#' @return a string that is formatted
comment_styler <- function(x, doc_mode=FALSE, l=80) {
  
  starter_regex <- '(\\s*#+\\s*)(.*)'
  
  if(doc_mode)
    starter_regex <- '(\\s*#{2,}\\s*)(.*)'
  
  if(grepl(starter_regex, x)){
    clean_x <- trimws(gsub('-*$', '', gsub('-+\\s+-+', '', trimws(x))))
    x <- str_pad(gsub(starter_regex, '# \\2 ', clean_x), 
                 width=l, side='right', pad='-')  
  }
  
  return(x)
}
```

As you can see, it's not very sophisticated. I just look for text in the Source 
pane that appear to be a section comment and pad the line up.

## How to Use this Addin

If you like the idea of my Addin you can install from RStudio with the following 
command: 

```{r install-my-addin, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("StevenMMortimer/sectioncomment")
```

After installing it should apper in your Addins dropdown and you can use it, like so:

My favorite reason to use is that I can write an entire outline of the steps I want 
to perform before writing a single line of code, then turn those steps into sections.

This a great way to force yourself to think about what you are 
going to code before diving in head first and getting lost in a jumbled mess of 
your own thoughts. I hope you enjoy using it as much as I do and you consider 
creating your own addin.
