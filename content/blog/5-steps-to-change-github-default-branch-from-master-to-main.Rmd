The R community is a diverse and inclusive group. About a month ago (June 2020)
GitHub <a target="_blank" href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/k7qbyv/github-to-remove-masterslave-terminology-from-its-platform">announced</a> it would start to remove references to 'master' across its
sites and I'm surprised the R community hasn't jumped on the opportunity to
be on the bleeding edge of this change. I think we can all take a very quick and
very small step forward in removing divisive language in tech by changing the default
branch name in R package repositories to 'main' instead of 'master'. There are a 
wealth of other posts/tutorials that others have written. Here is a small sampling 
listed in order of publishing date:

Eugene Shen even made a small web app to automate the entire process for you that is 
available at: (<a target="_blank" href="https://eyqs.ca/tools/rename/">https://eyqs.ca/tools/rename/</a>). 
I thought I'd share the 5 simple steps that I tested and used to make the change 
in **under 1 minute**. Yes, you can do this in under a minute, so what's stopping 
you? If you are concerned about compatibility, GitHub is providing updates on their 
renaming efforts here: <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/github/renaming">https://github.com/github/renaming</a>.

Below are screenshots to walk you through each step. In addition, there is a block 
of code with all Terminal commands in one place at the end of this post 
<a href="#all-commands">here</a> and GitHub repo here:

## Steps

  2. <a href="#step-2---push-main-to-remote-repo">Step 2 - Push 'main' to remote repo</a>
  3. <a href="#step-3---point-head-to-main-branch">Step 3 - Point HEAD to 'main' branch</a>
  4. <a href="#step-4---change-default-branch-to-main-on-github-site">Step 4 - Change default branch to 'main' on GitHub site</a>
  5. <a href="#step-5---delete-master-branch-on-the-remote-repo">Step 5 - Delete 'master' branch on the remote repo</a>

## Step 1 - Move the 'master' branch to 'main'

Run the following command which creates a branch called 'main' using the history 
from 'master'. Using the argument `-m` will transfer all of the commit history on 
the 'master' branch to your new 'main' branch so nothing gets lost.

```shell
git branch -m master main
```

## Step 2 - Push 'main' to remote repo

Remember that git is version control software on your local machine and GitHub 
is the remote server that stores your code. For this reason, you'll have to push 
your new 'main' branch up to GitHub and tell the local branch to start tracking 
the remote branch with the same name.

```shell
git push -u origin main
```

## Step 3 - Point HEAD to 'main' branch

At this stage if 'master' was your default branch you cannot remove it without 
first changing HEAD, the pointer to the current branch reference. This following 
command will point it to 'main'.

```shell
git symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD refs/remotes/origin/main
```

All three steps are shown in the screenshot below:

At this point you can take a breather. You're on the home stretch! If you want 
to check that things are going as planned then you're welcome to run the following 
that should show the HEAD is pointing to main which now frees you up to delete 'master'. 
**Note**: When you enter this command in your Terminal you will have to type `:q` to 
exit it. Not `CTRL+C`, `ESC`, etc.

```shell
git branch -a
```

## Step 4 - Change default branch to 'main' on GitHub site

At this point you've succesfully transitioned everything to the 'main' branch, but 
you can't delete the 'master' branch without changing the default branch in GitHub 
to something other than 'master'. This is the only step that requires you to leave 
the Terminal and navigate in your browser to your GitHub repository. From there, 
click `"Settings" -> "Branches"` on the left rail and change the default branch to 
'main'. I've included some screenshots below and GitHub provides instructions for 
doing this here: <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/setting-the-default-branch">https://docs.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/setting-the-default-branch</a>.

<img src="/blog/5-steps-to-change-github-default-branch-from-master-to-main/step-4c-confirm-change.png" style="display:block;max-height:300px;" />  

## Step 5 - Delete 'master' branch on the remote repo

Now that the local 'master' is gone and there's nothing pointing to it on Github 
you can delete it with the following command:  

```shell
git push origin --delete master
```

<img src="/blog/5-steps-to-change-github-default-branch-from-master-to-main/step-5-delete-remote-branch.png" style="display:block;max-height:75px;" />

That's it! You're done! You should no longer see "master" or "remotes/origin/master" locally 
or on your GitHub repository. If you want to check, you can always run the following: 

```shell
git branch -a
```

Feel free to let me know if this worked for you or if you had issues! **Note**: 
I take no responsibility for messing up your git repo. In case this wasn't clear 
enough, all instructions are available in its own repo here: <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/StevenMMortimer/master-to-main">https://github.com/StevenMMortimer/master-to-main</a>.
