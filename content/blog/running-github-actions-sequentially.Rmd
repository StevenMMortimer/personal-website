**TL;DR**: If you need sequential execution in GitHub Actions consider these solutions: 

  - <b>Sequential <u>steps</u></b>: Steps within a job are always executed sequentially!  
  
  - <b>Sequential <u>jobs</u></b>: Set `max-parallel: 1` within the <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idstrategymax-parallel"><code>jobs.strategy</code></a> element of the workflow.
  
  - <b>Sequential <u>workflows</u></b>: Use a `repository_dispatch` API call at the end of the workflow to trigger the next workflow (code available in the [An Example](#an-example) section below).

## The issue

Ever since the generally available release of GitHub Actions in November (2019), 
it seems like many R packages developed on GitHub have switched from Travis CI or 
another continuous integration service to now using GitHub Actions (GHA). It seems 
like a great service to have integrated as closely as possible to your codebase, 
but the product is still under active development. There is a dedicated 
<a target="_blank" href="https://github.community/c/github-actions">tag</a> in 
the GitHub Support Community to ask questions and browse answers. However, in a 
few different questions (<a target="_blank"
href="https://github.community/t/triggering-a-new-workflow-from-another-workflow/16250">here</a>, <a target="_blank"
href="https://github.community/t/run-next-job-sequentially-even-if-a-previous-job-fails/17404">here</a>, and <a target="_blank"
href="https://github.community/t/steps-in-parallel/16343">here</a>) it seems like folks are still grappling 
with GitHub's design decision to execute all workflows and jobs in a repository 
in parallel, myself included.  

As background, it is important to note here the basic lingo of GitHub Actions. A 
repository can contain one or more 'workflows' defined by YAML files located in 
the `.github/workflows` folder in the top level of the repository. Each
'workflow' can contain one or more 'jobs' that execute a series of 'steps'. 
By default, all steps in a single job execute sequentially. If you're trying to 
limit the number of parallel 'jobs' then you you can set a limit of 1 for the 
workflow by setting `max-parallel: 1` within the <a target="_blank"
href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idstrategymax-parallel"><code>jobs.strategy</code></a>
element of the workflow YAML. However, the issue with multiple jobs in a single
workflow is that if one job fails out of 10 jobs in your workflow, then
you'll have to re-run all 10 jobs for the workflow status to be a success. For
this reason, I have decided to split jobs across different workflows. This way, 
I can re-run one individually, if needed. I will refer to 'jobs' and
'workflows' interchangeably throughout this article because you can have workflows 
that execute one job and one job only.

**Why do I need sequential workflows/jobs?**

The reason I need this functionality is that my workflows interact with a 3rd-party 
service (Salesforce) and one workflow might affect the results of another
workflow if accessing the service simultaneously. I also want to prevent other
workflows from executing if I can't get the first one to succeed since the issue 
could occur across all workflows. This allows me to reduce the total number
of API calls to Salesforce which are capped in a 24-hour period by catching issues 
early before other workflows execute.

## An Example

You can setup sequential workflows using a `repository_dispatch` action in 4
easy steps:  

  1. <a href="#step-1---create-a-personal-access-token-pat">Step 1 - Create a Personal Access Token (PAT)</a>
  2. <a href="#step-2---add-the-pat-as-an-actions-secret-in-the-repository">Step 2 - Add the PAT as an actions secret in the repository</a>
  3. <a href="#step-3---add-the-repository_dispatch-event-to-workflow-1">Step 3 - Add the repository_dispatch event to Workflow 1</a>
  4. <a href="#step-4---add-the-repository_dispatch-event-as-trigger-in-workflow-2-yaml">Step 4 - Add the repository_dispatch event as trigger in Workflow 2 YAML</a>

For context, a required element in every workflow the name of the
GitHub event that triggers the workflow. For example, `on: pull_request` means
"execute this workflow every time a pull request is opened". If you want to run
workflows sequentially, then you just need to issue a specific event type that
lets the next workflow know when to begin. You could try to write your own solution
that uses the GitHub Actions APIs to list the workflows, jobs, or check-suites
and find out which ones have failed or not, but the easy alternative is to use a
`repository_dispatch` event.

>"You can use this endpoint to trigger a webhook event called repository_dispatch when you want activity that happens outside of GitHub to trigger a GitHub Actions workflow or GitHub App webhook."

<sup><a target="_blank" href="https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/#create-a-repository-dispatch-event">https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/#create-a-repository-dispatch-event</a></sup>

Workflows aren't aware of other workflows, so this event webhook is perfect to trigger, 
or "daisy-chain", separate workflows. You could execute the event via a `curl` command 
from the shell in a new job step, but I recommend using the <a target="_blank"
href="https://github.com/marketplace/actions/repository-dispatch"><i>Repository
Dispatch</i></a> action that Peter Evans has released in the GitHub Marketplace, 
which makes it dirt simple to execute a repository dispatch event from a workflow.

### Step 1 - Create a Personal Access Token (PAT)
Follow GitHub's instructions <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token">here</a> and 
when it comes time to select the scopes, or permissions, you'd like to grant the
token then check `"repo"` if you're on a private repository or `"public_repo"` if
you're on a public one.

### Step 2 - Add the PAT as an actions secret in the repository
Follow GitHub's instructions <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/creating-and-storing-encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository">here</a>. I recommend naming the secret `REPO_GHA_PAT`.

<img src="/blog/running-github-actions-sequentially/new-secret.png" style="display:block;margin:auto;max-width:500px;" />
  
### Step 3 - Add the `repository_dispatch` event to Workflow 1
This step is where you update Workflow 1's YAML file. For this example, consider
"Workflow 1" as the workflow, and the job(s) contained within it, as what you'd
like to execute first. Think of "Workflow 2" as the workflow you'd like to
execute after "Workflow 1". Add the following as the last step in the workflow YAML 
file: 

```yaml
- name: Trigger next workflow
  if: success()
  uses: peter-evans/repository-dispatch@v1
  with:
    token: ${{ secrets.REPO_GHA_PAT }}
    repository: ${{ github.repository }}
    event-type: trigger-workflow-2
    client-payload: '{"ref": "${{ github.ref }}", "sha": "${{ github.sha }}"}'
```

In this example above, you'll notice the line `if: success()`. This means that, only 
if all the prior steps in the workflow were successful, we should run this step 
that triggers Workflow 2. Also you should notice the line which passes data from 
Workflow 1 to Workflow 2: 

```javascript
client-payload: '{"ref": "${{ github.ref }}", "sha": "${{ github.sha }}"}'
```

In this case it is telling Workflow 2 the branch and commit hash to checkout and
use so that we know Workflows 1 and 2 are using the same exact code. Remember,
it's possible that you have a couple different Workflow 1's running because
you've pushed code or triggered them in some way and you want to make sure each
one triggers the same code in Workflow 2.

### Step 4 - Add the `repository_dispatch` event as trigger in Workflow 2 YAML
This step is where you update Workflow 2's YAML file. First, add your event name as 
the type of repository dispatch that should trigger Workflow 2. This name 
must match exactly as what you specified the `event-type` we covered in Step 3 
(the last step of Workflow 1). In our case we called the event to trigger Workflow 2 
as `event-type: trigger-workflow-2`. This could be called anything you wish. The 
important part is using the same name in the `types` key of the Workflow 2 YAML 
file. It should be included within square brackets and without quotes as shown below:  

```yaml
name: Workflow 2

on:
  repository_dispatch:
    types: [trigger-workflow-2]
```

Second, use the client payload data from the event to checkout the same code. You 
can so this by modifying the checkout step, usually one of the  first step in your job.

```yaml
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
        with:
          ref: ${{ github.event.client_payload.sha }}
      
      ... (other steps)
      
      - uses: r-lib/actions/setup-r@master
      
      - uses: r-lib/actions/setup-pandoc@master
```

That's it! If you have more than 2 workflows, then simply add a unique trigger as 
the last step in each workflow that calls the next. For the first workflow, I typically 
trigger based on a push to a certain branch like this: 

```yaml
name: Workflow 1

on:
  push:
    branches: main
```

## Considerations

If you need your jobs to execute sequentially but you want them to all still
run, even if some fail, then just change the `if:` statement mentioned above in Step 3 
to `if: always()`. The only reason I did not do this is that even if the following 
workflow is successful, it will get triggered again when we re-run the failed workflow, 
which I didn't want. In order to achieve that you may need to use some more
advanced tricks/hacks to only execute if the next workflow has the same `sha` 
<b><u>and</u></b> the latest run does not have a 'completed' status.

Another consideration is the cost to execute GitHub actions in private repositories. 
It's true that many projects will not likely need to enforce sequential workflows 
because the tests, examples, checks or dependencies do not affect other
workflows. However, GitHub Actions is only free for public respositories. You
may have private repositories and want to limit the amount of processing time so
you can stay within the free tier (less than 2,000 minutes per month).
Sequential execution can prevent all the workflows from executing if upstream
workflows fail.
