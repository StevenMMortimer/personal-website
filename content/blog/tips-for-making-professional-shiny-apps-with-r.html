<p>If you’ve built a Shiny app with R you’ll know how exciting it feels to get your
first app up and running. Shiny is an amazing tool for R users, but how do you
take it to the next level? This post with outline five easy ways to make Shiny apps
more professional.</p>
<div id="add-a-progress-wheel" class="section level3">
<h3>Add a Progress Wheel</h3>
<p>I’ll start with the progress wheel because it is the easiest and most impactful
change to make. Oftentimes, Shiny apps involve calculations that take more than
one second to execute. It can be a frustrating experience for the user to interact
with an application and wait without knowing what is happening. Is the application
busy doing some calculation? Did the user select the correct button? Is the server
down? You have likely been in this situation yourself as a user of the web. There
are a few different ways to implement a progress indicator, but I have found the
simplest and most effective solution already in the <a href="https://github.com/AnalytixWare/ShinySky"><code>shinysky</code> package</a>.
The <code>busyIndicator()</code> function allows you to specify a custom message and wait
time before the progress wheel appears.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>busyIndicator(text = &quot;Calculation in progress ... &quot;, wait = 0)</code></pre>

</div>
<div id="create-a-www-folder" class="section level3">
<h3>Create a www Folder</h3>
<p>Most web applications contain extra resources or libraries to enhance their
appearance and functionality. Shiny apps are no different. If you would like to
include images, styling, or even JavaScript, then all of these files should be
contained inside a single folder entitled <code>www</code> that is located in the same directory
as the <code>ui.R</code> and <code>server.R</code> files. The <code>www</code> folder is the main location for all
web resources in your application. If you would like to enforce a global standard
of styling, then create a <code>.css</code> file containing the CSS stylesheet language for
formatting. If you would like to add images or GIFs to your Shiny app, then place
them in the www folder as well. Shiny supports most image file formats such as
<code>.jpg</code>, <code>.png</code>, and <code>.gif</code>. If you would like to add JavaScript logic, then
create a <code>.js</code> file containing any functions or variables that you would
like to execute. Again, place this file inside the <code>www</code> folder. Note that you must
explicitly reference these files inside the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> tag of your app. The best way to
add to your app is by using <code>tags$head()</code> and <code>tags$link()</code> like this:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>tags$head(
  tags$link(rel = &quot;stylesheet&quot;, type = &quot;text/css&quot;, 
            href = &quot;style.css&quot;)
)</code></pre>
<p>You can even give your app a bookmark icon using the link tag instead of the head tag!</p>
<pre class="r"><code>tags$link(rel = &quot;shortcut icon&quot;, type = &quot;image/x-icon&quot;, 
          href = &quot;my-shortcut-icon.ico&quot;)</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="style-with-css" class="section level3">
<h3>Style with CSS</h3>
<p>If you are deploying your Shiny apps in a professional setting, it is a best practice
to format and style your apps using rules defined by the CSS stylesheet language.
This will reduce the amount of time and effort to style new applications and provide a clean
and consistent experience so that users quickly become familiar with how elements
of your apps function based on a consistent appearance. Using CSS in Shiny apps
is no different from styling a traditional web page, so any resource teaching CSS
will help, such as, the W3Schools CSS Tutorial available at <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/css/" target="_blank">http://www.w3schools.com/css/</a>.
A Shiny CSS guide is also available at <a href="http://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/css.html" target="_blank">http://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/css.html</a></p>

<div id="use-a-global.r-file" class="section level3">
<h3>Use a global.R file</h3>
<p>It is good practice when coding software to place commonly used pieces of logic
in a central location. You can put this concept into practice by creating a <code>global.R</code>
file for your Shiny app. The <code>global.R</code> file is not a requirement for a
Shiny app, but it will reduce redundant code and increase the app’s speed by re-using
logic and variables from a global scope among concurrent app users. The <code>global.R</code>
file should be located in the same directory as the <code>ui.R</code> and <code>server.R</code> files.
Whenever a Shiny app is first used, the <code>global.R</code> file makes its logic available
to the <code>ui.R</code> and <code>server.R</code> files. This speeds up your app because it is only
runs once (when the app is first launched). Typically, <code>global.R</code> is a good place
for loading libraries, sourcing R functions or variables needed by your app, and
setting options like <code>stringsAsFactors = FALSE</code>.</p>

<div id="encourage-data-downloading" class="section level3">
<h3>Encourage Data Downloading</h3>
<p>A big part of Shiny’s value proposition in the enterprise is promoting data democracy and the
free sharing of information for use to further benefit the company. Shiny app users may
prefer other tools, such as Excel or Tableau or Python. Empower your users and allow
them the flexibility to intergrate into their preferred tool. The best way to facilitate that
is to allow downloads of the data. The best package by far for displaying data and allowing for
downloads is the <code>datatable</code> package. The following code snippet creates a row for your
download button and then the datatable. I recommend pulling the button to the right of the
screen using <code>float: right;</code> in your CSS so the button is naturally placed at the top
right of your table and ready for the user to click.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>fluidRow(
  column(12, downloadButton(&quot;downloadDataFromTable&quot;, &quot;Download Table Data&quot;))
)
fluidRow(
  column(12, DT::dataTableOutput(&quot;campaign_table&quot;, width = &quot;100%&quot;))
)</code></pre>
