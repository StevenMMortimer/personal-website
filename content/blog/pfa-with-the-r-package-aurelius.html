<p>I first heard about the Portable Format for Analytics (PFA) through KDnuggets in
2016. There was a <a href="http://www.kdnuggets.com/2016/01/portable-format-analytics-models-production.html" target="_blank">post</a> that in vague way talked about the virtues and benefits of PFA, but not to completely
supplant PMML, which I was already familiar with. PMML was pretty cool, but I
couldn’t find good support and felt that the XML-based approach was clumsy and
outdated so when I heard about PFA, I was pretty excited. A new JSON-based standard
for encoding any type of analytics, not just certain supported models like PMML.
I mainly work in the R programming language, so I was disappointed to find resources
lacking that would convert models made in R into the PFA standard. The great
folks at the <a href="http://dmg.org" target="_blank">Data Mining Group</a> (DMG)
had started on an R package called <code>aurelius</code> that contained the bare bones functions
to construct the syntax. After reading through the Project pages on GitHub, I saw
everything was there, but it wasn’t as convenient as I would like so I started
writing “model producers”. Model producers are functions that convert model objects
in R into their PFA equivalent to be exported and used in other systems. In this
process I learned a great deal. I thought I knew how models worked, but actually
reading through the mechanics of scoring has made me appreciate them so much more.
Below is an outline of working with the <code>aurelius</code> package, but note that this work
has yet to be integrated into the project and exists on forked branch in my GitHub
(installation command shown below).</p>
<pre class="r"><code># you only need to run this once because it 
# installs the package
devtools::install_github(&#39;StevenMMortimer/hadrian&#39;, 
                         ref=&#39;feature/add-r-package-structure&#39;, 
                         subdir=&#39;aurelius&#39;, 
                         quick=T) </code></pre>
<p>In this example we’ll load the randomForest package to demonstrate how to convert
randomForest models into PFA. Currently, the package converts models of many types:
<code>lm</code>, <code>glm</code>, <code>glmnet</code>, <code>gbm</code>, <code>randomForest</code>, <code>naivebayes</code>, <code>lda</code>, <code>kcca</code>, and <code>kmeans</code>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>options(stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
library(aurelius)
library(randomForest) </code></pre>
<div id="pfa-structure" class="section level2">
<h2>PFA Structure</h2>
<p>Before we get started it’s helpful to understand the basic components of a valid
PFA document. Every PFA document has an input spec, output spec, and an action.
The reason for the specifications on the input and output is so that the machine
executing your PFA can safely and reliably excute. PFA relies on the
<a href="http://avro.apache.org/" target="_blank">Avro serialization format</a>
for its type system, whichsupports your typical primitive data types like
boolean, integer, and string, but also, arrays, maps, and
<a href="http://dmg.org/pfa/docs/avro_types/" target="_blank">more</a>. You can
define these types in R by using any of the functions like <code>avro_*</code>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>avro_double
#&gt; [1] &quot;double&quot;

avro_enum(list(&quot;one&quot;, &quot;two&quot;))
#&gt; $type
#&gt; [1] &quot;enum&quot;
#&gt; 
#&gt; $symbols
#&gt; $symbols[[1]]
#&gt; [1] &quot;one&quot;
#&gt; 
#&gt; $symbols[[2]]
#&gt; [1] &quot;two&quot;
#&gt; 
#&gt; 
#&gt; $name
#&gt; [1] &quot;Enum_1&quot;</code></pre>
<p>After specifying inputs and outputs, you must specify an action. With <code>aurelius</code>
an action can be specified from an R expression. A simple example is <code>2+2</code>. This
can be expanded to manipulate the input and/or derivatives of it. Here is a
simple analytics spec that takes a double and adds 10 to it.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>pfa_document(input = avro_double, 
             output = avro_double, 
             action = expression(input + 10))
#&gt; $input
#&gt; [1] &quot;double&quot;
#&gt; 
#&gt; $output
#&gt; [1] &quot;double&quot;
#&gt; 
#&gt; $action
#&gt; $action[[1]]
#&gt; $action[[1]]$`+`
#&gt; $action[[1]]$`+`[[1]]
#&gt; [1] &quot;input&quot;
#&gt; 
#&gt; $action[[1]]$`+`[[2]]
#&gt; [1] 10</code></pre>
<p>You’ll notice that the resulting output is a list. PFA is based on JSON, so it’s
natural for the document, when it’s in R, to be a list that can always later be
converted to JSON for export.</p>

<div id="converting-a-tree-model" class="section level2">
<h2>Converting a Tree Model</h2>
<p>Let’s step through a more realistic example that predicts the species in the iris
dataset, based on the other variables using a random forest model. First, format
the columns to meet Avro guidelines: <code>[A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9_]*</code>. Having periods
in the variable names (e.g. <code>Sepal.Length</code>) is not encouraged.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># make sure column names dont have periods in them
iris2 &lt;- iris
colnames(iris2) &lt;- gsub(&#39;\\.&#39;, &#39;_&#39;, colnames(iris2)) </code></pre>
<p>Creating the PFA is very easy. Simply fit your model, then call <code>pfa()</code>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># fit a random forest model
rf_model &lt;- randomForest(Species ~ ., data=iris2) 
 
# convert that model to PFA
# pred_type=&#39;prob&#39; means that the output is the 
# probability of all classes. If you want 
# the majority vote, then specify pred_type=&#39;response&#39;
# check all options by running ?pfa.randomForest
rf_model_as_pfa &lt;- pfa(rf_model, pred_type=&#39;prob&#39;) </code></pre>
<p>If you have the <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rPython/index.html" target="_blank">rPython</a> package
installed and <a href="https://github.com/opendatagroup/hadrian/wiki/Installation#case-4-you-want-to-install-titus-in-python" target="_blank">Titus</a> (PFA for Python), then you can create an engine in R
and see how the PFA behaves. In this case it predicts the same as the <code>predict()</code>
function in R. This way we can test that the behavior of the PFA is what we expect.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># you can check the predictions from this model
# by first converting to a pfa_engine
pfa_model &lt;- pfa_engine(rf_model_as_pfa) 
 
# confirm that the pfa engine produces the 
# same prediction as the &quot;predict&quot; method in R
test_dat &lt;- iris2[73,1:4]
round(pfa_model$action(as.list(test_dat)), 6)
#&gt;     setosa versicolor  virginica 
#&gt;       0.00       0.83       0.17
round(unclass(predict(object=rf_model, newdata=test_dat, type=&#39;prob&#39;)), 6) 
#&gt;    setosa versicolor virginica
#&gt; 73      0       0.83      0.17</code></pre>
<p>Once you’re happy with your model, just export to a flat file using <code>write_pfa()</code>.
This format can be read and used by any PFA interpreter. With R you can read the
file back in using <code>read_pfa()</code>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># you can export your model for use in other systems
write_pfa(rf_model_as_pfa, file = &#39;~/my_rf_model.pfa&#39;)

my_model &lt;- read_pfa(file(&quot;~/my_rf_model.pfa&quot;))

# see that all PFA components are there
names(my_model)
#&gt; [1] &quot;input&quot;  &quot;output&quot; &quot;action&quot; &quot;cells&quot;</code></pre>

<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>PFA is a measurable step in open, portable, and reprodcible analytics. I hope to
see the standard more widely adopted and tools developed to help others implement it.
One final thing: Check out the
<a href="https://github.com/StevenMMortimer/hadrian/tree/feature/add-r-package-structure/aurelius/tests/testthat" target="_blank">unit tests</a>.
I’ve recently added quite a bit of unit test coverage and these tests are an
excellent source of examples because they cover most all cases of utilizing the
package functions.</p>
