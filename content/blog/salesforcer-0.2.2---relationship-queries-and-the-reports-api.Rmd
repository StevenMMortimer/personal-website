The latest version of the {salesforcer} package (v0.2.2) is now available on CRAN 
and is ready to help you have better access to data in your Salesforce Org. Along 
with a host of bug fixes this release has three big features:  

  1. <u>**Experimental Functions for the Reports and Dashboards REST API**</u> (jump 
  to <a href="#experimental-functions-for-reports-and-dashboards-rest-api">section</a>) - Now 
  you have programmatic access to executing and managing reports, dashboards, and 
  analytics notifications in your Org. You can familiarize yourself with the 
  Salesforce documentation <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"  href="https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.api_analytics.meta/api_analytics/sforce_analytics_rest_api_intro.htm">HERE</a>. Not all functions have been implemented yet, but your questions, comments, 
  and feedback are welcome!

  2. <u>**Support for Bulk 2.0 API Queries**</u> (jump to 
  <a href="#support-for-bulk-2.0-api-queries">section</a>) - In Salesforce version 47.0 
  (Winter '20) query jobs in the Bulk API 2.0 were added. Now you can leverage 
  this resource from the {salesforcer} package in addition to the queries via 
  the REST, SOAP, and Bulk 1.0 APIs.
  
    
  3. <u>**Support for Relationship Queries**</u> (jump to 
  <a href="#support-for-relationship-queries">section</a>) - In previous versions of the package the 
  child-to-parent and nested parent-to-child queries did not work or returned a 
  jumbled mess of results that were not parsed correctly. This version fixes those 
  issues in both the REST and SOAP APIs with better test coverage on a variety of 
  query types.
  
For a complete list of updates, please review the release notes from v0.2.0 onwards 
listed on the {salesforcer} pkgdown site here: <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://stevenmmortimer.github.io/salesforcer/news/index.html">https://stevenmmortimer.github.io/salesforcer/news/index.html</a>.

## Experimental Functions for Reports and Dashboards REST API

Salesforce has rich support for Reports in your Salesforce Org. Sometimes
reports are a better way to collaborate with other users because they can create
reports in the GUI or you can create one for them so they always have access to
the most current recordset meeting your report criteria. The challenge comes
when trying to access this data programmatically. Fortunately, Salesforce
provides the <a target="_blank"
href="https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.api_analytics.meta/api_analytics/sforce_analytics_rest_api_intro.htm">Reports
and Dashboards REST API</a> as a means to not only execute Reports, but to also
manage them in your Org.

In Salesforce there is a dedicated page to displaying the list of reports in your 
Org. It typically follows the pattern: `https://na1.salesforce.com/00O/o` 
(replace `na1` with your server instance). When you click on a report in the GUI 
you should see the report's results. Below is a screenshot of how a report may 
look in your Org (note the report Id in the URL bar): 

<img src="/blog/salesforcer-0.2.2---relationship-queries-and-the-reports-api/report-screenshot.png" style="display:block;margin:auto;max-height:500px;" />

The report Id above (`"00O3s000006tE7zEAE"`) is the only information needed to pull 
those same results from an R session, like so: 

```{r simple-report}
my_report_id <- "00O3s000006tE7zEAE"
results <- sf_run_report(my_report_id)
results
```

Currently, all of the report related functionality in the Reports and Dashboards 
REST API has been ported into the {salesforcer} package and you can do some pretty 
neat stuff like on-the-fly filtering and sorting: 

```{r filtered-report}
# filter records that was created before this month
filter1 <- list(column = "CREATED_DATE",
                        operator = "lessThan", 
                        value = "THIS_MONTH")

# filter records where the account billing address city is not empty
filter2 <-  list(column = "ACCOUNT.ADDRESS1_CITY",
                        operator = "notEqual", 
                        value = "")

# combine filter1 and filter2 using 'AND' which means that records must meet both filters
results_using_AND <- sf_run_report(my_report_id, 
                                   report_boolean_logic = "1 AND 2",
                                   report_filters = list(filter1, filter2))
results_using_AND

# combine filter1 and filter2 using 'OR' which means that records must meet one 
# of the filters but also throw in a row limit based on a specific sort order
results_using_OR <- sf_run_report(my_report_id, 
                                  report_boolean_logic = "1 OR 2",
                                  report_filters = list(filter1, filter2), 
                                  sort_by = "Contact.test_number__c", 
                                  decreasing = TRUE, 
                                  top_n = 3)
results_using_OR
```

For more detail on how to take advantage of this new functionality please see
the pkgdown website <a target="_blank"
href="https://stevenmmortimer.github.io/salesforcer">https://stevenmmortimer.github.io/salesforcer</a>
and, more specifically, the <a target="_blank"
href="https://stevenmmortimer.github.io/salesforcer/articles/working-with-reports.html">Working
with Reports vignette</a> which provides a soft introduction to these concepts.
Finally, keep an eye out as more dashboard and analytics notifications
functionality is also added.

## Support for Bulk 2.0 API Queries

In Salesforce version 47.0 (Winter '20) query functionality added to
the Bulk 2.0 API. In the overview of this feature Salesforce emphasizes the
consistency with the REST APIs and the ease of use (e.g. "Automatic File
Batching"), but does not mention any claims in terms of speed compared to the
Bulk 1.0 query functionality. In {salesforcer 0.2.2} the default API when using
`sf_run_bulk_query()` or `sf_query_bulk()` is now the Bulk 2.0 API, assuming it
is better than the Bulk 1.0 API. However, You can easily switch between the APIs
just as you did before in previous {salesforcer} releases by specifying it in the 
`api_type` argument. Please note that, because of additional standardization on 
the column ordering and arguments to guess types, the queries below will all 
return the same exact format of results. For example we prioritize the following 
fields in queries alphabetically within this prioritization waterfall: 

  1. First, the `sObject` field (indicates the record's object if multiple objects returned in the results)
  2. Second, the Id field (`Id`, `id`, `sf__Id`)
  3. Third, record success status (`Success`, `success`, `sf_Success`)
  4. Fourth, record created status (`Created`, `created`, `sf__Created`)
  5. Fifth, record error(s) status (`Error`, `error`, `errors`, 
  `errors.statusCode`, `errors.fields`, `errors.message`, `sf__Error`)
  6. Sixth, all other fields from the target object (e.g. `Name`, `Phone`, etc.)
  7. Seventh, relationship fields (fields from a parent or child of the target). For example, 
  anything typically containing a dot like `Account.Id`, `Owner.Name`, etc.

In short, Bulk 2.0 now has query functionality and it is consistent with the
other API's query functionality. I recommend checking to see for yourself which
API works well. Below is a simple example comparing a single run of the REST,
Bulk 1.0, and Bulk 2.0 APIs. Consider using the {microbenchmark} package to run
more precise performance tests.

```{r queries-comparison}
soql <- "SELECT Id, LastName, Account.Id, Account.Name, Owner.Id
         FROM Contact
         LIMIT 1000"
system.time(sf_query(soql, api_type = "REST"))
system.time(sf_query(soql, object_name = "Contact", api_type = "Bulk 1.0"))
system.time(sf_query(soql, api_type = "Bulk 2.0"))
```

## Support for Relationship Queries

One upgrade for {salesforcer 0.2.2} is better support for relationship queries, 
both child-to-parent lookups using the dot notation and parent-to-child nested 
queries. In prior releases the results were not parsed consistently and presented 
themselves in a variety of hard to debug issues on GitHub that were brought up in <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/StevenMMortimer/salesforcer/issues/19">#19</a>, <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/StevenMMortimer/salesforcer/issues/35">#35</a>, <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"  href="https://github.com/StevenMMortimer/salesforcer/issues/38">#38</a>, and <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"  href="https://github.com/StevenMMortimer/salesforcer/issues/54">#54</a>. This 
release finally aims to address some of those bugs through more consistent parsing methods 
for both the XML returned by the SOAP API and the JSON returned by the REST API. However, 
I would strongly recommend testing in your Org with your own queries to see the 
impact before deploying to a production environment. If any unexpected behavior 
crops up, then please file an issue on GitHub using the [query issue template](https://github.com/StevenMMortimer/salesforcer/issues/new?assignees=StevenMMortimer&labels=&template=query-issue-template.md&title=) so we can get it resolved.

**Old Nested Query Behavior (v0.1.4 or earlier)**
```r
sf_query("SELECT Name, (SELECT LastName FROM Contacts) FROM Account", api_type="SOAP")
#> # A tibble: 24 x 4
#>    Id    Name                        Contacts         LastName
#>    <lgl> <chr>                       <list>           <chr>   
#>  1 NA    GenePoint                   <named list [4]> <NA>    
#>  2 NA    <NA>                        <NULL>           Frank   
#>  3 NA    United Oil & Gas, UK        <named list [4]> <NA>    
#>  4 NA    <NA>                        <NULL>           James   
#>  5 NA    United Oil & Gas, Singapore <named list [5]> <NA> 
#> # … with 19 more rows
```

**New Query Behavior (v0.2.2)**

```r
sf_query("SELECT Name, (SELECT LastName FROM Contacts) FROM Account", api_type="SOAP")
#> # A tibble: 16 x 4
#>    Name                        Contact.LastName
#>    <chr>                       <chr>
#>  1 GenePoint                   Frank
#>  2 United Oil & Gas, UK        James
#>  3 United Oil & Gas, Singapore D'Cruz
#>  4 United Oil & Gas, Singapore Ripley
#>  5 Edge Communications         Forbes
#> # … with 11 more rows
```

A new vignette has been included with this release that covers the types of
queries currently supported by the package and is available here: <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://stevenmmortimer.github.io/salesforcer/articles/supported-queries.html">Supported
Queries</a>. I highly recommend reviewing for guidance and inspiration on how to 
what types of queries are possible running against your Org.
