<p>In this article I will highlight the features of VS Code that match RStudio
exactly, such as the “interactive notebook window” (called the Console in R) or
the “variable explorer” (like running <code>View()</code> on a data frame in RStudio). At
the bottom of this post I will provide two JSON files (<code>settings.json</code> and
<code>keybindings.json</code>) and a block of code to install from the command line a list
of extensions that I recommend. By using these files as a guide you can
configure your VS Code installation to do a pretty good job at mimicking
RStudio.</p>
<p><strong>First, why try to write Python like you write R code in RStudio??</strong></p>
<p>RStudio is a great all around IDE for data analysis. A few years ago I was
transitioning from writing a lot of R code to more Python code at work. I
initially chose PyCharm as my Python IDE for a variety of reasons outlined in
another blog post of mine: <a target="_blank"
href="https://stevenmortimer.com/an-r-user-chooses-a-python-ide/">An R User
Chooses a Python IDE</a>. However, as of last summer (June 2019), I switched to
VS Code as a Python IDE and never looked back. In hindsight, PyCharm just seems
too clunky with an over-engineered GUI of buttons to click and not really be
sure what’s going on. VS Code is making great strides towards becoming an IDE
that works well for the REPL (read–eval–print loop) style of coding that RStudio
excels at supporting. I love how lightweight VS Code feels and how the
configurations are portable via JSON files making it easier to share a common
config with team members. I’ll keep writing R code in RStudio, but VS Code is
quckly becoming a second home for me to write Python code.</p>

<div id="aesthetics-textmate-theme-and-margin-column-ruler" class="section level3">
<h3>Aesthetics (Textmate theme and margin column ruler)</h3>
<p>You may know that the default theme in RStudio is “Textmate”. This is found in
<code>Tools -&gt; Global Options -&gt; Appearance</code>. To get the color scheme in VS Code you
can install this with the <a target="_blank"
href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=gerane.Theme-textmate">Textmate theme extension</a>.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/setting-up-vs-code-for-python-development-like-rstudio/textmate-theme.png" style="display:block;margin:auto;max-height:300px;" /></p>
<p>I tend to not change much beyond the default RStudio installation just so that I
don’t need to maintain a unique and unfamiliar setup compared to other
colleagues who are also using RStudio. The only customization I recommend is
adding a vertical line at 80 characters. This is a must-have feature to keep
your code readable and you can do the same with VS Code by specifying
<code>"editor.rulers"</code> in your user settings. More detail on how to configure that is in
the section of this post entitled <a href="#settings-json-file">Settings JSON File</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="running-code" class="section level3">
<h3>Running Code</h3>
<p>As far as running code in RStudio, it is fairly common to write code in the
“Source” pane (normally above the console), then send the code to the “Console”
pane to run using <code>CMD+ENTER</code> (<code>CRTL+ENTER</code> if on Windows - please assume
anywhere I refer to <code>CMD</code> in this article it is <code>CTRL</code> if you use Windows). In
VS Code you can think of the Editor pane as having the exact same purpose
(writing a script), but instead of sourcing lines to the “Console” you use the same
command (<code>CMD+ENTER</code>) to run the code in the Python Interactive Window. More
specifically, the keyboard shortcut you need to set in VS Code is for the
command <code>"python.datascience.execSelectionInteractive"</code>.</p>
<p>This is a game changer when writing Python code for analysis because you no
longer need to code in a Jupyter Notebook to execute your analysis. Simply write
your code in a <code>.py</code> file and press <code>CMD+ENTER</code> to execute line-by-line in the
Python Interactive Window. Repeat this process as you run code, explore, and
build out your analysis. Note that you can also type Python directly into the
Interactive Window just like you can type directly in R’s Console as well to
execute code.</p>

<div id="variable-explorer-environment-tab-in-r" class="section level3">
<h3>Variable Explorer (“Environment” tab in R)</h3>
<p>Notebooks always seem clunky in terms of executing single lines of code and
reviewing variables in the global environment, but VS Code has a variable
explorer just like the “Environment” tab in R.</p>

</div>
</div>
<div id="data-viewer-like-running-view-in-r" class="section level3">
<h3>Data Viewer (Like running <code>View()</code> in R)</h3>
<p>Once you’ve created a <strong>pandas</strong> DataFrame you can explore a dynamic view of the
data frame with basic filtering and sorting. I have found this be exactly like
the <code>View()</code> function in RStudio. The only difference is it does seem to
struggle a bit when viewing data frames over 1 million rows. It is laggy or
crashes VS Code, but I don’t find that too much of a problem because you can
always save a sample of your dataset into a variable or aggregate your data
prior to viewing.</p>

</div>
</div>
<div id="plot-viewer-plots-tab-in-r" class="section level3">
<h3>Plot Viewer (“Plots” tab in R)</h3>
<p>You can flip through prior plots, save them, resize, and interact with plots the
same way as you would in the “Plots” pane of RStudio. Nothing different here.</p>

</div>
</div>
<div id="version-control-git-tab-in-r" class="section level3">
<h3>Version Control (“Git” tab in R)</h3>
<p>Just like RStudio you can stage files, write a commit message, and push to a git
repository. Instead of ticking a checkbox to stage files, you will have to press
the <code>+</code> sign, which is about the only difference. Everything else is the similar
as far as clicking on the files to see “diffs”, writing the commit message, and
pushing code to a remote repository.</p>

</div>
<p>All of these git features can be made even
better with Eric Amodio’s <a target="_blank"
href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens">GitLens
extension</a>, which I highly recommend. It makes it easier to navigate
branches, see when files were changed and by whom.</p>

<h2>What’s missing or different in VS Code?</h2>
<div id="rs-document-outline-aka-minimap-in-vs-code" class="section level3">
<h3>R’s Document Outline (aka Minimap in VS Code)</h3>
<p>RStudio creates a nice outline of your scripts based on your functions and
comments that start with:</p>
<pre class="r"><code># A new section ----
code here...</code></pre>
<p>This table of contents style view is helpful. As a somewhat suitable alternative
I have become accustomed to annotating Python code blocks with region folding
syntax which creates collapsible code sections in the VS Code editor.</p>
<pre class="py"><code># region ----

code here...

# endregion</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="debugging" class="section level3">
<h3>Debugging</h3>
<p>RStudio has a nice feature that will ask you if you want to run a piece of code
with debug mode on if it initially errors. VS Code’s Python Interactive Window
also prints out error messages, but will not let you debug with the click of a
button. You can however set breakpoints and run your script in debug mode, which
is a familiar experience, just not as seamless as RStudio.</p>
<p>There are obviously many other features, like having a built-in terminal, remote
connections, app development via Shiny, etc. that make R/RStudio and Python/VS
Code different tools, but if you’re just running analysis the two can provide
very similar workflows, right down to the keyboard shortcuts. The only challenge
you may have left is figuring out how to make your <strong>pandas</strong> code as legible and
well organized as <strong>dplyr</strong> code… but that is for another day. (Hint: It’s possible
with a strong commitment to method chaining).</p>

<h3>Keyboard Shortcuts JSON File</h3>
<p>Updating the keyboard shortcuts JSON file is similar to editing <code>settings.json</code>.
Open the Command Palette with <code>CMD+SHIFT+P</code> and select <code>"Preferences: Open Keyboard Shortcuts (JSON)"</code> to edit the JSON file where your settings are held.
You can copy/paste the entire block of JSON below or just individual lines.</p>
<p>In addition to setting the keyboard shortcut <code>CMD+ENTER</code> to execute lines in the
Interactive Window I have set a few other two keyboard shortcuts to work exactly
like RStudio. For example, clearing the console and restarting the R session:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>CRTL+L</code> - “Clear Console” (in RStudio) =&gt; Clear Cells (in Python Interactive Window)</li>
<li><code>CMD+SHIFT+F10</code> - “Restart R” (in RStudio) =&gt; Restart Kernel (in Python Interactive Window)</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course there are other shortcuts that you can configure like R’s block
comment command (<code>Code -&gt; Comment/Uncomment Lines</code>) (CMD+SHIFT+C). Simply set
the VS Code command <code>"editor.action.commentLine"</code> to that shortcut.</p>
<p>Another example is R’s command (<code>Code -&gt; Reflow Comment</code>) which hard wraps code
to 80 characters using <code>CMD+SHIFT+/</code>. VS Code can do the same after installing
the extension called “rewrap” and then giving its command
<code>"rewrap.rewrapComment"</code> the same keyboard shortcut. It is really up to you to
configure the shortcuts that you use most often.</p>

<h3>Extensions Installation Script</h3>
<p>You can run each of the lines below in your Terminal or other Command Prompt
after installing VS Code in order to install the extensions. <strong>NOTE</strong>: This does
require having the <code>code</code> command in your PATH. On Mac use the following instructions
to install ‘code’ command in PATH: <a target="_blank" href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/mac#_launching-from-the-command-line">https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/mac#_launching-from-the-command-line</a>.
Alternatively, you can search for extensions in the VS Code Marketplace and install
from there (more detail is available here:
