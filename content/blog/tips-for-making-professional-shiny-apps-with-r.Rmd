If you've built a Shiny app with R you'll know how exciting it feels to get your 
first app up and running. Shiny is an amazing tool for R users, but how do you 
take it to the next level? This post with outline five easy ways to make Shiny apps 
more professional.

### Add a Progress Wheel
I'll start with the progress wheel because it is the easiest and most impactful 
change to make. Oftentimes, Shiny apps involve calculations that take more than 
one second to execute. It can be a frustrating experience for the user to interact 
with an application and wait without knowing what is happening. Is the application 
busy doing some calculation? Did the user select the correct button? Is the server 
down? You have likely been in this situation yourself as a user of the web. There 
are a few different ways to implement a progress indicator, but I have found the 
simplest and most effective solution already in the [`shinysky` package](https://github.com/AnalytixWare/ShinySky). 
The `busyIndicator()` function allows you to specify a custom message and wait 
time before the progress wheel appears.

```{r example-progress-wheel, eval=FALSE}
busyIndicator(text = "Calculation in progress ... ", wait = 0)
```

### Create a www Folder
Most web applications contain extra resources or libraries to enhance their 
appearance and functionality. Shiny apps are no different. If you would like to 
include images, styling, or even JavaScript, then all of these files should be 
contained inside a single folder entitled `www` that is located in the same directory 
as the `ui.R` and `server.R` files. The `www` folder is the main location for all 
web resources in your application. If you would like to enforce a global standard 
of styling, then create a `.css` file containing the CSS stylesheet language for 
formatting. If you would like to add images or GIFs to your Shiny app, then place 
them in the www folder as well. Shiny supports most image file formats such as 
`.jpg`, `.png`, and `.gif`. If you would like to add JavaScript logic, then 
create a `.js` file containing any functions or variables that you would 
like to execute. Again, place this file inside the `www` folder. Note that you must 
explicitly reference these files inside the `<head>` tag of your app. The best way to 
add to your app is by using `tags$head()` and `tags$link()` like this: 

```{r css-link, eval=FALSE}
tags$head(
  tags$link(rel = "stylesheet", type = "text/css", 
            href = "style.css")
)
```

You can even give your app a bookmark icon using the link tag instead of the head tag!

```{r icon-link, eval=FALSE}
tags$link(rel = "shortcut icon", type = "image/x-icon", 
          href = "my-shortcut-icon.ico")
```

### Style with CSS
If you are deploying your Shiny apps in a professional setting, it is a best practice 
to format and style your apps using rules defined by the CSS stylesheet language. 
This will reduce the amount of time and effort to style new applications and provide a clean 
and consistent experience so that users quickly become familiar with how elements 
of your apps function based on a consistent appearance. Using CSS in Shiny apps 
is no different from styling a traditional web page, so any resource teaching CSS 
will help, such as, the W3Schools CSS Tutorial available at <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/css/" target="_blank">http://www.w3schools.com/css/</a>. 
A Shiny CSS guide is also available at <a href="http://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/css.html" target="_blank">http://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/css.html</a>

### Use a global.R file
It is good practice when coding software to place commonly used pieces of logic 
in a central location. You can put this concept into practice by creating a `global.R`
file for your Shiny app. The `global.R` file is not a requirement for a 
Shiny app, but it will reduce redundant code and increase the app's speed by re-using 
logic and variables from a global scope among concurrent app users. The `global.R` 
file should be located in the same directory as the `ui.R` and `server.R` files. 
Whenever a Shiny app is first used, the `global.R` file makes its logic available 
to the `ui.R` and `server.R` files. This speeds up your app because it is only 
runs once (when the app is first launched). Typically, `global.R` is a good place 
for loading libraries, sourcing R functions or variables needed by your app, and 
setting options like `stringsAsFactors = FALSE`.

### Encourage Data Downloading
A big part of Shiny's value proposition in the enterprise is promoting data democracy and the 
free sharing of information for use to further benefit the company. Shiny app users may 
prefer other tools, such as Excel or Tableau or Python. Empower your users and allow 
them the flexibility to intergrate into their preferred tool. The best way to facilitate that 
is to allow downloads of the data. The best package by far for displaying data and allowing for 
downloads is the `datatable` package. The following code snippet creates a row for your 
download button and then the datatable. I recommend pulling the button to the right of the 
screen using `float: right;` in your CSS so the button is naturally placed at the top 
right of your table and ready for the user to click.

```{r datatable-snippet, eval=FALSE}
fluidRow(
  column(12, downloadButton("downloadDataFromTable", "Download Table Data"))
)
fluidRow(
  column(12, DT::dataTableOutput("campaign_table", width = "100%"))
)
```
