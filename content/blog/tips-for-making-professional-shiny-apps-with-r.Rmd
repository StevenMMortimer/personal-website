If you've built a Shiny app with R you'll know how exciting it feels to get your 
first app up and running. Shiny is an amazing tool for R users, but how do you 
take it to the next level? This post with outline five easy ways to make Shiny apps 
more professional.

### Add a Progress Wheel
I'll start with the progress wheel because it is the easiest and most impactful 
change to make. Oftentimes, Shiny apps involve calculations that take more than 
one second to execute. It can be a frustrating experience for the user to interact 
with an application and wait without knowing what is happening. Is the application 
busy doing some calculation? Did the user select the correct button? Is the server 
down? You have likely been in this situation yourself as a user of the web. There 
are a few different ways to implement a progress indicator, but I have found the 
simplest and most effective solution already in the `shinysky` package [LINK????] 
The `busyIndicator()` function allows you to specify a custom message and wait 
time before the progress wheel appears.

```{r example-progress-wheel, eval=FALSE}
busyIndicator(text = "Calculation in progress ... ", wait = 0)
```

### Create a www Folder
Most web applications contain extra resources or libraries to enhance their 
appearance and functionality. Shiny apps are no different. If you would like to 
include images, styling, or even JavaScript, then all of these files should be 
contained inside a single folder entitled `www` that is located in the same directory 
as the `ui.R` and `server.R` files. The `www` folder is the main location for all 
web resources in your application. If you would like to enforce a global standard 
of styling, then create a `.css` file containing a style sheet language for formatting 
(styling for css is our next tip). If you would like to add images or GIFs to your 
Shiny app, then place them in the www folder as well. Shiny supports most image 
file formats such as `.jpg`, `.png`, and `.gif`. If you would like to add JavaScript 
logic, then create a `.js` file containing any functions or variables that you would 
like to execute. Again, place this file inside the `www` folder. Note that you must 
explicitly reference these files in the `<head>` tag of your app. The best way to 
add to your app is by using `tags$head()` and `tags$link()` like this: 

```{r css-link, eval=FALSE}
tags$link(rel = "stylesheet", type = "text/css", 
          href = "style.css")
```

You can even add web bookmark icons in the head tag!

```{r icon-link, eval=FALSE}
tags$link(rel = "shortcut icon", type = "image/x-icon", 
          href = "my-shortcut-icon.ico")
```

### Style with CSS
If you are deploying your Shiny apps in a professional setting, it is best practice 
to format and style your apps using rules defined by the CSS stylesheet language. 
This will reduce the amount of work to style new applications and provide a clean 
and consistent experience so that users quickly become familiar with how elements 
of your app function based on their consistent appearance and functionality in 
other apps. Using CSS in Shiny apps is no different from styling a traditional 
web page, so any resource teaching CSS will help, such as, the W3Schools CSS 
Tutorial available at http://www.w3schools.com/css/. A Shiny CSS guide is also 
available at http://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/css.html.

### Use a global.R file
It is good practice when coding software to place commonly used pieces of logic 
in a central location. You can put this concept into practice by creating a `global.R`
file for each of your Shiny apps. The `global.R` file is not a requirement for a 
Shiny app, but it will reduce redundant code and increase the speed by re-using 
logic and variables from a global scope among concurrent app users. 

The `global.R` file should be located in the same directory as the `ui.R` and 
`server.R` files. Whenever a Shiny app is first used, the `global.R` file makes 
its logic available to the `ui.R` and `server.R` files. This speeds up your app 
because it is only runs once. Typically, `global.R` is a good place for loading 
libraries, sourcing R functions or variables needed by your app, and setting 
options like `stringsAsFactors = FALSE`.

### Encourage Downloading Data
A big part of Shiny's value proposition in the enterprise is data democracy or freely 
sharing information for use to further benefit the company. Typically, Shiny app users 
will prefer other tools, such as Excel or Tableau or Python. Empower your users and allow 
them the flexibility to intergrate into their preferred tool. The best way to facilitate that 
is to allow downloads of the data. The best package by far for displaying data and allowing for 
downloads is the `datatable` package. The following code snippet creates a row for your 
download button and then the datatable. I recommend pulling the button to the right of the 
screen using `float: right;` in your CSS so the button is naturally placed at the top 
right ready for the user to click.

```{r datatable-snippet, eval=FALSE}
fluidRow(
  column(12, downloadButton("downloadDataFromTable","Download Table Data"))
)
fluidRow(
  column(12, DT::dataTableOutput("campaign_table", width = "100%"))
)
```
