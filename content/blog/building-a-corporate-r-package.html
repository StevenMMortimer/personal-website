<p>If you don’t feel comfortable centralizing credentials for security reasons or your team doesn’t have shared credentials, then have those stored locally in a profile and called by the package in a standardized way.</p>
<div id="analytical-functions" class="section level3">
<h3>Analytical Functions</h3>
<p>Creating functions is a programming best practice. They are easier to monitor, test, and teach to others. If your team performs routine calculations, establish a standard by adding functions to the shared library and encourage everyone to use those functions. For example:</p>
<p>[ some r code here? ]</p>
<p>I strongly encourage using the R style guide [link] formats of Google and Hadley. Much of the styling can be boiled down into two rules:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Name your functions with verbs and objects with nouns</li>
<li>Use snake case</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="company-constants" class="section level3">
<h3>Company Constants</h3>
<p>Again, if you’re looking to enforce standards, it’s a great practice to include well-known constants in your R package. For example:</p>
<p>[ some r code here? ]</p>
</div>
<div id="templatingformatting" class="section level3">
<h3>Templating/Formatting</h3>
<p>A little bit of formatting goes a long way if your team routinely presents figures internally and/or externally. Consider adapting a ggplot2 theme to your company’s colors, fonts, and other styling. Here are two links to get you started in making custom theme:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">

</ol>
<p>Also, you might find that a majority of stakeholder in your company prefer receiving data in Excel. You can export data from R to Excel with bolded, proper case column names, format columns as percentages and dollar signs so that your stakeholders are happy getting data from you. I highly recommend working with the <a href="">openxlsx package</a>, which does not require Java. Below is a snippet of code that will transform column names, set column widths based on the data, and format them based on some key words in the column names like formatting columns ending in “pct” as a percentage.</p>

<div id="tutorials" class="section level3">
<h3>Tutorials</h3>
<p>Finally, but maybe most importantly, R packages help teammembers grow and on-board faster. You can include sample datasets and plenty of examples within the R package so that new members of your team don’t have to ask around how to do certain things. They can read the documentation and try the examples for themselves. Consider the R package a legacy asset of your team that will stand the test of time well after you’ve left the company.</p>
