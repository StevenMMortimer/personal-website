<p>The latest version of the <strong>salesforcer</strong> package (v0.1.3) is now available on CRAN
and it is ready to help you better manage your Salesforce data. Along with a host
of bug fixes this release has three big features:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Pull lists of deleted and updated records by timeframe and be able to undelete
them or permanently delete them from the Recycle Bin to free up space in your org</li>
<li>Search for duplicates using the duplicate rules in your org and merge records</li>
<li>Control API call behaviors to perform “All or None” inserts, bypass duplicate rules,
configure the transfer of related records when changing a record’s owner, and more</li>
</ol>
<div id="pulling-lists-of-delete-and-updated-records" class="section level2">
<h2>Pulling Lists of Delete and Updated Records</h2>
<p>Salesforce is an organizational tool and with many hands touching the system sometimes
you are called in to do some detective work to figure out which records have been
deleted or updated in your org. Luckily, Salesforce has your back. Their SOAP API has
two methods that will return the deleted or updated records within a timeframe. Those
two methods have been implemented in <strong>salesforcer</strong> 0.1.3 as <code>sf_get_deleted()</code> and
<code>sf_get_updated()</code>. Here is an example pulling out anything deleted yesterday:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)

# if no timezone is provided UTC is assumed
deleted_recs &lt;- sf_get_deleted(&quot;Contact&quot;, start = Sys.Date() - 1, end = Sys.Date())
# here is how to pull deleted using yesterday according to EDT with help from lubridate
deleted_recs &lt;- sf_get_deleted(&quot;Contact&quot;, 
                               start = ymd(Sys.Date()-1, tz=&quot;America/New_York&quot;), 
                               end = ymd(Sys.Date(), tz=&quot;America/New_York&quot;))
deleted_recs
#&gt; # A tibble: 125 x 2
#&gt;   deletedDate         id                
#&gt;   &lt;dttm&gt;              &lt;chr&gt;             
#&gt; 1 2020-09-11 19:08:40 0033s000014AyIXAA0
#&gt; 2 2020-09-11 19:08:40 0033s000014AyIbAAK
#&gt; 3 2020-09-11 19:08:46 0033s000014AyIgAAK
#&gt; 4 2020-09-11 19:11:08 0033s000014AyLFAA0
#&gt; 5 2020-09-11 19:11:08 0033s000014AyLGAA0
#&gt; # … with 120 more rows</code></pre>
<p>Now if you see records in there that you may want back, now it’s as simple as calling
the <code>sf_undelete()</code> function with the ids of the records you want.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># undelete the first three records from the list of records deleted yesterday 
undeleted &lt;- sf_undelete(deleted_recs$id[1:3])
undeleted
#&gt; # A tibble: 3 x 2
#&gt;   id                 success
#&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;              &lt;lgl&gt;  
#&gt; 1 0033s000014AyIXAA0 TRUE   
#&gt; 2 0033s000014AyIbAAK TRUE   
#&gt; 3 0033s000014AyIgAAK TRUE</code></pre>
<p>You can double check that the records are actually no longer deleted by running a
query for them and checking the <code>IsDeleted</code> field like this:</p>
<pre class="r"><code># check that the first three records are no longer deleted 
is_not_deleted &lt;- sf_query(sprintf(&quot;SELECT Id, IsDeleted 
                                    FROM Contact 
                                    WHERE Id IN (&#39;%s&#39;)&quot;, 
                                   paste0(undeleted$id, collapse=&quot;&#39;,&#39;&quot;)))
is_not_deleted
#&gt; # A tibble: 3 x 2
#&gt;   Id                 IsDeleted
#&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;              &lt;lgl&gt;    
#&gt; 1 0033s000014AyIXAA0 FALSE    
#&gt; 2 0033s000014AyIbAAK FALSE    
#&gt; 3 0033s000014AyIgAAK FALSE</code></pre>
<p>Now let’s say you really do want them deleted and by that, I mean permanently
from your org so they do not count against your space quota. Now you can empty
items in your Recycle Bin. Here is an example where we delete the records we just
undeleted and then empty them from the Recycle Bin.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># delete the records to move them to the Recycle Bin, them empty them from it
deleted &lt;- sf_delete(is_not_deleted$Id)
really_deleted &lt;- sf_empty_recycle_bin(deleted$id)
really_deleted
#&gt; # A tibble: 3 x 2
#&gt;   id                 success
#&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;              &lt;lgl&gt;  
#&gt; 1 0033s000014AyIXAA0 TRUE   
#&gt; 2 0033s000014AyIbAAK TRUE   
#&gt; 3 0033s000014AyIgAAK TRUE</code></pre>
<p>If you want to double-check the field values of a deleted record, just make sure to
set <code>queryall = TRUE</code> in your query so that it returns deleted or archived records in the
resultset. Note that after records are deleted from the Recycle Bin using this call,
they can be queried using <code>queryall = TRUE</code> for some time. Typically this time is
24 hours, but may be shorter or longer.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># permanently deleted records not there in regular query
not_visible &lt;- sf_query(sprintf(&quot;SELECT Id, IsDeleted 
                                 FROM Contact 
                                 WHERE Id IN (&#39;%s&#39;)&quot;, 
                                paste0(really_deleted$id, collapse=&quot;&#39;,&#39;&quot;)))
not_visible
#&gt; # A tibble: 0 x 0

# but still there if using queryall for ~24 hrs
still_visible &lt;- sf_query(sprintf(&quot;SELECT Id, IsDeleted 
                                   FROM Contact 
                                   WHERE Id IN (&#39;%s&#39;)&quot;, 
                                  paste0(really_deleted$id, collapse=&quot;&#39;,&#39;&quot;)), 
                          queryall = TRUE)

#&gt; 1 0033s000014AyIXAA0 TRUE

<div id="searching-for-duplicates-and-merging-them" class="section level2">
<h2>Searching for Duplicates and Merging Them</h2>
<p>Part of having a Salesforce instance means maintaining a high-level of data integrity.
That means not allowing duplicates to crop up and, if they do, merging and deleting
them quickly so that any activity with a record can be tracked in a single place.
In <strong>salesforcer</strong> 0.1.3 you can find duplicates using the Duplicate Rules already in
place in your org. In the example below I will create three records with the same
email address. I’ve already set up a Duplicate Rule in my org to recognize and prevent
records from being creating if they have the same email address as another record already
in Salesforce. When I run <code>sf_find_duplicates()</code> it finds all three records.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># create the records 
new_contacts &lt;- tibble(FirstName = rep(&quot;Rick&quot;, 3), 
                       LastName = rep(&quot;James&quot;, 3), 
                       Email = rep(&quot;rick.james@gmail.com&quot;, 3),
                       Description = c(&quot;Musician&quot;, &quot;Funk Legend&quot;, NA))
new_contacts
#&gt; # A tibble: 3 x 4
#&gt;   FirstName LastName Email                Description
#&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;chr&gt;                &lt;chr&gt;      
#&gt; 1 Rick      James    rick.james@gmail.com Musician   
#&gt; 2 Rick      James    rick.james@gmail.com Funk Legend
#&gt; 3 Rick      James    rick.james@gmail.com &lt;NA&gt;</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code># insert the records
new_recs &lt;- sf_create(new_contacts, &quot;Contact&quot;, 
                      DuplicateRuleHeader = list(allowSave = TRUE,
                                                 includeRecordDetails = FALSE,
                                                 runAsCurrentUser = TRUE))

                                  object_name = &quot;Contact&quot;)
#&gt; Using Contact rules:
#&gt;   - Standard_Rule_for_Contacts_with_Duplicate_Leads
#&gt;   - Contact_Dupe_Email

#&gt; 5 Contact 0033s000014B3IaAAK
#&gt; # … with 1 more row</code></pre>
<p>The recordset from <code>sf_find_duplicates()</code> shows the object that the records were found in
and their Ids. You will notice that those are the same Ids as what we received back when
creating the records to verify that we found those same three records based on the duplicated
email address. You will also notice in the call that there is a message showing which
rules were executed when searching for duplicates, one of them being a custom matching rule
I created called <code>Contact_Dupe_Email</code>. In order for this function to work you must
have Duplicate Rules configured in your system. There is a lot of good documentation
online about how to set up these rules. Here is a link to one Salesforce Trailhead article
that I like: <a target="_blank" href="https://trailhead.salesforce.com/en/content/learn/modules/sales_admin_duplicate_management/sales_admin_duplicate_management_unit_2">Resolve and Prevent Duplicate Data</a>.</p>
<p>Now if I’d like to merge those three duplicates records into one I can do so using
the new <code>sf_merge()</code> function. I need to pick one of the records as the <code>master record</code>
and supply its Id to the function. The other records’ Ids will be the <code>victim_ids</code>.
All of the fields on the master record will supercede the others, but if you would
like to override some of those fields, then just specify them in the <code>master_fields</code>
argument. In this example, we are merging the second and third record into the first
record. However, I like the description “Funk Legend” from the second record to be
on the master record, so I just specify it in the <code>master_fields</code> argument.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>merge_summary &lt;- sf_merge(master_id = dupes_found$Id[1], 
                          victim_ids = dupes_found$Id[2:3], 
                          object_name = &quot;Contact&quot;,
                          master_fields = c(&quot;Description&quot; = &quot;Funk Legend&quot;))
merge_summary
#&gt; # A tibble: 1 x 5
#&gt;   id                 success mergedRecordIds updatedRelatedIds errors
#&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;              &lt;lgl&gt;   &lt;list&gt;          &lt;lgl&gt;             &lt;lgl&gt; 
#&gt; 1 0033s000013Xt92AAC TRUE    &lt;chr [2]&gt;       NA                NA</code></pre>
<p>You can check that the other two records that were merged into the master record have
now been deleted and that they are tagged in the <code>MasterRecordId</code> field with the Id
of the master record they were merged into.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>merge_confirm &lt;- sf_query(sprintf(&quot;SELECT Id, MasterRecordId, IsDeleted 
                                   FROM Contact 
                                   WHERE Id IN (&#39;%s&#39;)&quot;, 
                                  paste0(dupes_found$Id, collapse=&quot;&#39;,&#39;&quot;)), 
                          queryall = TRUE)

#&gt; # … with 1 more row</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="controlling-api-call-behavior" class="section level2">
<h2>Controlling API Call Behavior</h2>
<p>You may have noticed an argument called <code>all_or_none</code> in the previous CRAN release
of <strong>salesforcer</strong>. This argument is put into the header of the API call so that when
records are created/updated/deleted it will only complete if all records were successful,
otherwise all of the record changes are rolled back. This “All or None” behavior is just
one of over a dozen headers that the SOAP API accepts. The REST, Bulk, and Metadata APIs
also have their own headers which can be set. You can pass these controls into <strong>salesforcer</strong>
functions directly or by setting the <code>control</code> argument that now appears in many functions.
For example, if you are inserting records and would like to bypass the Duplicate Rules
in your org, then set the <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.api.meta/api/sforce_api_header_duplicateruleheader.htm">DuplicateRuleHeader</a>) like this:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>new_contacts &lt;- tibble(FirstName = rep(&quot;Test&quot;, 2),
                       LastName = rep(&quot;Contact&quot;, 2), 
                       Email = rep(&quot;testcontact@gmail.com&quot;, 2))

# add control to allow the creation of records that violate a duplicate email rule
new_recs &lt;- sf_create(new_contacts, object_name = &quot;Contact&quot;, 
                      DuplicateRuleHeader = list(allowSave = TRUE,
                                                 includeRecordDetails = FALSE,
                                                 runAsCurrentUser = TRUE))
new_recs
#&gt; # A tibble: 2 x 2
#&gt;   id                 success
#&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;              &lt;lgl&gt;  
#&gt; 1 0033s000014B3IjAAK TRUE   
#&gt; 2 0033s000014B3IkAAK TRUE</code></pre>
<p>In the documentation you may notice that the control argument in the <code>sf_create()</code> function definition
looks like this <code>control = list(...)</code>. This allows you to include the control headers
as an argument right in the function or put them inside the <code>sf_control</code> function.
An example of using the <code>sf_control()</code> function looks like this:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>new_recs &lt;- sf_create(new_contacts, object_name = &quot;Contact&quot;, 
                      control=sf_control(DuplicateRuleHeader=list(allowSave=TRUE,
                                                                  includeRecordDetails=FALSE,
                                                                  runAsCurrentUser=TRUE)))
new_recs
#&gt; # A tibble: 2 x 2
#&gt;   id                 success
#&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;              &lt;lgl&gt;  
#&gt; 1 0033s000014B3HhAAK TRUE   
#&gt; 2 0033s000014B3HiAAK TRUE</code></pre>
<p>The <code>sf_control()</code> function works exactly like <code>glm.control()</code> when using the <code>glm()</code>
function in the <strong>stats</strong> package. It will accept any of the extra arguments in the
function call and validate them to see if they are accepted by the API type and operation
that the function is performing. As mentioned before, there are over a dozen control
parameters that are now possible across the various APIs. Those are documented on the
pkgdown website’s documentation for <a target="_blank" href="https://stevenmmortimer.github.io/salesforcer/reference/sf_control.html"><code>sf_control()</code></a>.
There is also a vignette which describes all of this in more detail at <a target="_blank" href="https://stevenmmortimer.github.io/salesforcer/articles/passing-control-args.html">Passing Control Args</a>.</p>
