## The Square Data Model

Whether you own your own business or consult for a business using Square to capture 
payment data, Square can offer some amazing opportunities to gain insights by 
leveraging their Connect v1 & v2 APIs. The Square data backend operates much like 
a CRM system that holds information about *transactions* that *customers* make 
when purchasing *items* offered at a *location*. Naturally, there are API endpoints 
for each of the object types italicized above (Locations, Customers, Transactions, and Items) 
and many more endpoints for administrative tasks (employees, roles, timecards, refunds, etc.).

## Authenticating

While working with Square data I decided to develop an R package 
<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/StevenMMortimer/squareupr"><b>squareupr</b></a>
that makes it easier to retrieve Square data from R so that you can focus on 
the analysis. After installing the **squareupr** package you must authenticate by 
supplying a personal access token (PAT) or using an OAuth 2.0 flow. You can find your 
PAT by logging into the <a target="_blank" href="https://squareup.com">Square Dashboard</a> 
-> Apps -> My Apps. Create an app or click "Manage App" if you've already created one and 
there you should see your personal access token: 

![](/blog/analyzing-customer-data-from-square/finding-your-pat.png)

```{r, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(squareupr)
sq_auth(personal_access_token = Sys.getenv("SQUARE_PAT"))
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# The squareupr package is not yet available on CRAN so you must install from GitHub
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("StevenMMortimer/squareupr")

library(tidyverse)
library(squareupr)

# authenticate using your Personal Access Token (PAT)
sq_auth(personal_access_token = "sq-Th1s1sMyPers0nalAcessT0ken")
```

The package also offers OAuth 2.0 authentication. More information is available 
<a target="_blank" href-"https://github.com/StevenMMortimer/squareupr#authenticate">here</a>.

## Pulling Transaction Data

As mentioned above there are endpoints for every major type of data stored by Square. 
The <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.connect.squareup.com/api/connect/v2">API documentation</a> 
does a very good job at laying out how requests should be made to each of those endpoints. One 
thing to note is that it is important to first pull down the location details for 
your business because the location is often required when searching for things like 
transactions and items.

```{r list-locations}
our_locations <- sq_list_locations()
our_locations$name <- "{HIDDEN}"
our_locations %>% select(id, name, address, timezone, 
                        capabilities, status, created_at)
```

Now that you have the location ids if you would like to pull all of the transactions 
during a given timeframe, you would use the function `sq_list_transactions()`.

```{r list-transactions}
# list all transactions for our 2nd location on May 11, 2018
# by default, if a date is provided with no time, then the time component is set to midnight
our_transactions <- sq_list_transactions(location = our_locations$id[2], 
                                         begin_time = as.Date('2018-05-11'), 
                                         end_time = as.Date('2018-05-12'))
our_transactions
```

At first glance there does not appear to be very much detail on the transaction record. 
However, the `tender` field represents a method of payment used in a Square transaction 
so it contains information regarding the amount of money paid in total, in Square fees, 
and tip. The `tender` field even contains information regarding the `customer_id` and 
credit card information. In the following I will loop through the transactions in 
April 2018 and determine the total spend for each customer in the dataset. Note: 
The call to `sq_list_transactions` may take a couple minutes to complete if you are pulling 
thousands of transactions.

```{r customer-spend}
april_transactions <- sq_list_transactions(location = our_locations$id[2], 
                                           begin_time = as.Date('2018-04-01'), 
                                           end_time = as.Date('2018-05-01'))
```

In order to extract the customer ID and money spent I create a function 
that checks for the `tender` object on the transaction and if it exists tries 
to extract the data into a `tbl_df`. When I supply this function as 
`map_df(extract_cust_info_func) %>% ` I get the data from each transaction stacked 
into a single `tbl_df` that's ready to analyze.

```{r extract-and-compute}
# create a function that will extract out just the customer id and money spent
extract_cust_info_func <- function(x){
  if(!is.null(x$tender)){
    tibble(customer_id = sq_null_to_na(x$tender[[1]]$customer_id),
           money_spent = sq_null_to_na(x$tender[[1]]$amount_money$amount))  
  } else {
    tibble(customer_id = NA_character_, 
           money_spent = NA_integer_)
  }
}

april_customer_spend <- april_transactions %>% 
  transpose() %>%
  # pull out just the information we want from each transaction
  map_df(extract_cust_info_func) %>%
  group_by(customer_id) %>%
  summarize(total_spend = sum(money_spent, na.rm=TRUE))

april_customer_spend
```

The amounts in `april_customer_spend` may seem large, but the Square APIs return 
money as integers that represent whole cents. If you divide by 100, then you will 
have the money amounts in dollars. 

## Spend by Customer Group

Square has this concept of "groups" that customers belong to. These groups can be 
fashioned to do marketing campaigns complete with email blasts. In our analysis 
let's further determine which groups these customers belong to. The Square API has 
an endpoint to retrieve one customer at a time; however, with large lists you 
may get subjected to rate limiting. Rate limiting is errors on your requests because 
too many are coming from the same application or access token. I would recommend 
pulling down the entire list of customers with `sq_list_customers()` and then 
matching them up in R.

```{r customer-details}
cust_groups <- sq_list_customers() %>%
  select(id, groups) %>%
  sq_extract_cust_groups() %>%
  # filter to only the groups designated automatically by Square
  filter(grepl("^CQ689YH4KCJMY", groups.id))

cust_groups
```

Now that we know the customer memberships, let's join back with the transaction data 
to determine the average total spend across the different membership groups. 

```{r spend-per-group}
cust_groups %>% 
  # bring in the spend data
  inner_join(., april_customer_spend, by=c('id'='customer_id')) %>%
  # group by the customer groups to find average spend per group
  group_by(groups.name) %>%
  summarize(avg_spend = mean(total_spend / 100, na.rm=TRUE))
```

## Issues with the APIs

What is great about this analysis is that we can use the Square APIs to quickly and 
reliably pull down transaction data, match it to customer information and 
see how certain customer groupings or campaigns are performing. However, I did find 
some quirks and drawbacks that I wish the Square team would consider: 

### Cannot Request Specific Fields
First, it would be nice to implement, as part of the query parameters, the ability to 
only return certain fields (e.g. the `id` and `groups` fields from the Customer object). 
This would help for two reasons: 1) It would improve the speed since only the required 
data would be passed across and 2) For analysts who do not want to deal with personally 
identifiable information (even in RAM) you would not be forced to pull information like 
phone number, email, names, and even credit card information. 

### Cannot Update Customer Groups Programmatically
Second, the API will **not** allow you to update the customer groups programmatically. 
This means that you are stuck using the dashboard to create and assign customers to the groups you 
want to analyze. It is a drag when you want to create a reproducible research workflow
to assign customer groups but the API hinders your ability to do so. 

### Customer ID Not On Transactions
Finally, it appears that the customer ID associated to a transaction is not reliably captured 
on every transaction's tender object. This means that you cannot get a complete 
picture of all the transactions. I believe part of this is an issue with the 
merchant capturing the customer information at the point of sale, but also partly 
Square's fault since they seem to be able to piece everything together in their 
dashboard. However, this is not the case with the APIs. Overall, the Square APIs 
are a rich data resource for helping run a business and they should only get better 
with time as development progresses.
