I recently wrote a blog post <a target="_blank" href="https://stevenmortimer.com/most-starred-r-packages-on-github/">here</a> 
comparing the number of CRAN downloads an R package gets relative to its number of 
stars on GitHub. What I didn't really think about during my analysis was whether or 
not scraping CRAN was a violation of its Terms and Conditions. I simply copy and 
pasted some code from <a target="_blank" href="https://www.r-bloggers.com/">R-bloggers</a> 
that seemed to work and went on my merry way. In hindsight, it would have been better 
to check whether or not the scraping was allowed and maybe find a better way to 
get the information I needed. Of course, there was a much easier way to get the 
CRAN package metadata using the function `tools::CRAN_package_db()` thanks to a hint 
from Maëlle Salmon provided in this <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/ma_salmon/status/1009525735277678593">tweet</a>. 

## How to Check if Scraping is Permitted

Also provided by Maëlle's tweet was the recommendation for using the **robotstxt** package 
(currently having 27 Stars + one Star that I just added!). It doesn't seem to be 
well known as it only has 6,571 total downloads. I'm hoping this post will help spread 
the word. It's easy to use! In this case I'll check whether or not CRAN permits bots 
on specific resources of the domain.

My other blog post analysis originally started with trying to get a list of all current R packages 
on CRAN by parsing the HTML from <a target="_blank" href="https://cran.rstudio.com/src/contrib">https://cran.rstudio.com/src/contrib</a>. 
The page looks like this:

The question is whether or not scraping this page is permitted according to the `robots.txt` file 
on the `cran.rstudio.com` domain. This is where the **robotstxt** package can help 
us out. We can check simply by supplying the domain and path that is used to form 
the full link we are interested in scraping. If the `paths_allowed()` function 
returns `TRUE` then we should be allowed to scrape, if it returns `FALSE` then we 
are not permitted to scrape.

```{r check-1, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(robotstxt)

paths_allowed(
  paths  = "/src/contrib", 
  domain = "cran.rstudio.com", 
  bot    = "*"
)
```

In this case the value that is returned is `TRUE` meaning that bots are allowed to scrape that 
particular path. This was how I originally scraped the list of current R packages, even though 
you don't really need to do that since there is the wonderful function `tools::CRAN_package_db()`. 

After retrieving the list of packages I decided to scrape details from the DESCRIPTION 
file of each package. Here is where things get interesting. CRAN's <a target="_blank" 
href="http://cran.rstudio.com/robots.txt">`robots.txt`</a> file shows that scraping the 
DESCRIPTION file of each package is not allowed.

Furthermore, you can verify this using the **robotstxt** package:

```{r check-2, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
paths_allowed(
  paths = "/web/packages/ggplot2/DESCRIPTION",
  domain = "cran.r-project.org", 
  bot    = "*"
)
```

However, when I decided to scrape the package metadata I did it by parsing the HTML 
from the canonical package link that resolves to the `index.html` page for the package. For 
example, <a target="_blank" href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=ggplot2">https://cran.r-project.org/package=ggplot2</a> 
resolves to <a target="_blank" href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggplot2/index.html">https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggplot2/index.html</a>. If you check whether scraping is allowed on this page, the **robotstxt** package 
says that it is permitted.

```{r check-3, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
paths_allowed(
  paths = "/web/packages/ggplot2/index.html",
  domain = "cran.r-project.org", 
  bot    = "*"
)

paths_allowed(
  paths = "/web/packages/ggplot2",
  domain = "cran.r-project.org", 
  bot    = "*"
)
```

This is a tricky situation because I can access the same information that is in the 
DESCRIPTION file just by going to the `index.html` page for the package where scraping 
seems to be allowed. In the spirit of respecting CRAN it logically follows that I should 
not be scraping the package index pages if the individual DESCRIPTION files are off-limits. 
This is despite there being no formal instruction from the `robots.txt` file about package 
index pages. All in all, it was an interesting bit of work and glad that I was able 
to learn about the **robotstxt** package so I can have it in my toolkit going forward.

**DISCLAIMER**: I only have a basic understanding of how `robots.txt` files work 
based on allowing or disallowing specified paths. I believe in this case CRAN's 
`robots.txt` broadly permitted scraping, but too narrowly disallowed just the DESCRIPTION 
files. Perhaps this goes back to an older time where those DESCRIPTION files really 
were the best place for people to start scraping so it made sense to disallow them. 
Or the reason could be something else entirely.

**UPDATE**: David G. Johnston messaged me and brought up an important point that 
the `robots.txt` file primarily is used to tell search engines whether or not 
to crawl certain portions of a domain. The "Terms of Use" might be a better place 
to begin looking for any limitations on the usage of the data for the type of project 
you are creating.
