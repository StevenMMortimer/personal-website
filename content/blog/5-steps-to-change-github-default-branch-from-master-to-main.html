<p>The R community is a diverse and inclusive group. About a month ago (June 2020)
GitHub <a target="_blank" href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/k7qbyv/github-to-remove-masterslave-terminology-from-its-platform">announced</a> it would start to remove references to ‘master’ across its
sites and I’m surprised the R community hasn’t jumped on the opportunity to
be on the bleeding edge of this change. I think we can all take a very quick and
very small step forward in removing divisive language in tech by changing the default
branch name in R package repositories to ‘main’ instead of ‘master’. There are a
wealth of other posts/tutorials that others have written. Here is a small sampling
listed in order of publishing date:</p>

</ul>
<p>Eugene Shen even made a small web app to automate the entire process for you that is
available at: (<a target="_blank" href="https://eyqs.ca/tools/rename/">https://eyqs.ca/tools/rename/</a>).
I thought I’d share the 5 simple steps that I tested and used to make the change in <strong>under 1
minute</strong>. Yes, you can do this in under a minute, so what’s stopping you? If you
are concerned about compatibility, GitHub is providing updates on their
renaming efforts here: <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/github/renaming">https://github.com/github/renaming</a>.</p>
<p>Below are screenshots to walk you through each step. In addition, there is a block
of code with all Terminal commands in one place at the end of this post
<a href="#all-commands">here</a> and GitHub repo here:

<h2>Steps</h2>

</ol>
</div>
<div id="step-1---move-the-master-branch-to-main" class="section level2">
<h2>Step 1 - Move the ‘master’ branch to ‘main’</h2>
<p>Run the following command which creates a branch called ‘main’ using the history
from ‘master’. Using the argument <code>-m</code> will transfer all of the commit history on
the ‘master’ branch to your new ‘main’ branch so nothing gets lost.</p>
<pre class="shell"><code>git branch -m master main</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="step-2---push-main-to-remote-repo" class="section level2">
<h2>Step 2 - Push ‘main’ to remote repo</h2>
<p>Remember that git is version control software on your local machine and GitHub
is the remote server that stores your code. For this reason, you’ll have to push
your new ‘main’ branch up to GitHub and tell the local branch to start tracking
the remote branch with the same name.</p>
<pre class="shell"><code>git push -u origin main</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="step-3---point-head-to-main-branch" class="section level2">
<h2>Step 3 - Point HEAD to ‘main’ branch</h2>
<p>At this stage if ‘master’ was your default branch you cannot remove it without
first changing HEAD, the pointer to the current branch reference. This following
command will point it to ‘main’.</p>
<pre class="shell"><code>git symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD refs/remotes/origin/main</code></pre>
<p>All three steps are shown in the screenshot below:</p>
<p><img src="/blog/5-steps-to-change-github-default-branch-from-master-to-main/steps-1-to-3-create-main-and-point-HEAD.png" style="display:block;max-height:300px;" /></p>
<p>At this point you can take a breather. You’re on the home stretch! If you want
to check that things are going as planned then you’re welcome to run the following
that should show the HEAD is pointing to main which now frees you up to delete ‘master’.
<strong>Note</strong>: When you enter this command in your Terminal you will have to type <code>:q</code> to
exit it. Not <code>CTRL+C</code>, <code>ESC</code>, etc.</p>
<pre class="shell"><code>git branch -a</code></pre>

</div>
<div id="step-4---change-default-branch-to-main-on-github-site" class="section level2">
<h2>Step 4 - Change default branch to ‘main’ on GitHub site</h2>
<p>At this point you’ve succesfully transitioned everything to the ‘main’ branch, but
you can’t delete the ‘master’ branch without changing the default branch in GitHub
to something other than ‘master’. This is the only step that requires you to leave
the Terminal and navigate in your browser to your GitHub repository. From there,
click <code>"Settings" -&gt; "Branches"</code> on the left rail and change the default branch to
‘main’. I’ve included some screenshots below and GitHub provides instructions for
doing this here: <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/setting-the-default-branch">https://docs.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/setting-the-default-branch</a>.</p>

</div>
<div id="step-5---delete-master-branch-on-the-remote-repo" class="section level2">
<h2>Step 5 - Delete ‘master’ branch on the remote repo</h2>
<p>Now that the local ‘master’ is gone and there’s nothing pointing to it on Github
you can delete it with the following command:</p>
<pre class="shell"><code>git push origin --delete master</code></pre>
<p><img src="/blog/5-steps-to-change-github-default-branch-from-master-to-main/step-5-delete-remote-branch.png" style="display:block;max-height:75px;" /></p>
<p>That’s it! You’re done! You should no longer see “master” or “remotes/origin/master” locally
or on your GitHub repository. If you want to check, you can always run the following:</p>
<pre class="shell"><code>git branch -a</code></pre>
<p><img src="/blog/5-steps-to-change-github-default-branch-from-master-to-main/final-check.png" style="display:block;max-height:80px;" /></p>
<p>Feel free to let me know if this worked for you or if you had issues! <strong>Note</strong>:
I take no responsibility for messing up your git repo. In case this wasn’t clear
enough, all instructions are available in its own repo here: <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/StevenMMortimer/master-to-main">https://github.com/StevenMMortimer/master-to-main</a>.</p>
