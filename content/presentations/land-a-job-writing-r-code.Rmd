## Summary

I was inspired to create this presentation after hearing Ruby enthusiast Chris Mar 
(<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/cmar">@cmar</a>) at a meetup talk. 
He laid out some very nice tips on becoming a Ruby programmer and I thought it 
would be interesting to put an R spin on the content. If you're preparing to get 
your first job writing R Code here are the key takeaways from the presentation: 

1. Pick a project you're passionate about that forces you to write R code
2. Build it and put it on GitHub with a nice README
3. Follow the R community (i.e. follow breaking news, influencers, and key conferences)
4. Be opinionated! Know popular packages and a preference for certain ones
5. Commit to open source
6. Find jobs specifically listing R skills and follow employees at that company
7. At the interview, say you're proficient and act curious and enthusiastic
8. When answering technical questions, ask for help and be yourself.
