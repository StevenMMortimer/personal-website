## Summary

The tidyverse might be as vast and complicated as the universe, but no doubt it's 
better organized. It pulls together a set of common packages that are well integrated 
and follow "tidy" data principles to accelerate your skills with R. Here is a list of 
topics covered in the presentation: 

1. The packages that compose the tidyverse (ggplot2, dplyr, tidyr, tibble, readr, purrr)
2. Defining "tidy data" principles
3. How to tidy data and tibbles
4. dplyr pipeline chaining
5. API data munging
6. Using the `map` function
7. Tidying models with the `broom` package
