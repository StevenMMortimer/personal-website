<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>I was inspired to create this presentation after hearing Ruby enthusiast Chris Mar
(<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/cmar"><span class="citation">@cmar</span></a>) at a meetup talk.
He laid out some very nice tips on becoming a Ruby programmer and I thought it
would be interesting to put an R spin on the content. If you’re preparing to get
your first job writing R Code here are the key takeaways from the presentation:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Pick a project you’re passionate about that forces you to write R code</li>
<li>Build it and put it on GitHub with a nice README</li>
<li>Follow the R community (i.e. follow breaking news, influencers, and key conferences)</li>
<li>Be opinionated! Know popular packages and a preference for certain ones</li>
<li>Commit to open source</li>
<li>Find jobs specifically listing R skills and follow employees at that company</li>
<li>At the interview, say you’re proficient and act curious and enthusiastic</li>
<li>When answering technical questions, ask for help and be yourself.</li>
</ol>
