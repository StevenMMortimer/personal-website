  Writing R packages and blog posts are a fun hobby. I believe I owe something to 
  the R community for providing me with the tools to be successful in my career. 
  I am not independently wealthy and I do not receive any compensation or grants 
  for this work, so I must spend most of my time doing other things to earn a 
  paycheck. There is no obligation whatsoever, but if you feel compelled to donate 
  directly to me for my work, then I'd greatly appreciate the help. Thank you!
