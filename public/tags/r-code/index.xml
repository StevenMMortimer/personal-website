      <description>Analytical Functions Company Constants Templating/Formatting Data Source Connections Tutorials   Analytical Functions Creating functions is a programming best practice. They are easier to monitor, test, and teach to others. If your team performs routine calculations, establish a standard by adding functions to the shared library and encourage everyone to use those functions. If your company works a lot with customer phone numbers, then write a function to standardize the formatting.</description>

      <description>The WYSIWYG Access Control Permissions Embedded Google Docs, Sheets, etc. Built In Google Search and Analytics Final Thoughts   The title of this post is probably off-putting to a large number of people. Why on earth would I use Google Sites for blogging, wiki, and technical documentation? Isn’t that old, outdated tech even though Google did release a newer version? To be honest, I agree with those objections. This blog isn’t written with Google Sites.</description>

      <description>I first heard about the Portable Format for Analytics (PFA) through KDnuggets in 2016. There was a post that in vague way talked about the virtues and benefits of PFA, but not to completely supplant PMML, which I was already familiar with. PMML was pretty cool, but I couldn’t find good support and felt that the XML-based approach was clumsy and outdated so when I heard about PFA, I was pretty excited.</description>

      <description>I never thought too much about RStudio addins, but I saw a few cool examples ( jadd, colorpicker, and addinslist) and decided to take a closer look. After a little research, it seemed easier than I thought. It was easier because RStudio provided some excellent documentation on addins and it turns out that if you can write R code, then you can write an RStudio addin.
My Idea Around the time I was looking at addins, I started taking advantage of a little RStudio trick to navigate long scripts.</description>

      <description>Common Data Deduping Logic
A while ago I was working on migration of 4 separate legacy Salesforce systems into a single org. Naturally, the lack of consistency and controls led to each of those systems containing slighly different versions of the same data. A requirement for the migration was to remove any duplicate records and preserve the best version of the truth for a single entity. This concept is known as master data management.</description>

      <description>If you’re a regular R user, then you’ve probably used or have seen the function duplicated(). If you’ve only grown up in the world of dplyr and other tidyverse packages with its cool function distinct(), then I highly envy you. In any case, you might find yourself using the duplicated() function when you need some more control. The function has a handy argument incomparables that allows you to ignore certain values when doing the comparison for duplicates.</description>

      <description>Where are the Examples? Cleaning Functions Framework The Functions Cleaning Phone Numbers Cleaning URLs Cleaning Zip Codes Cleaning Email Addresses    Where are the Examples? R is great for cleaning data and that’s why I was surprised that I couldn’t find very many examples or even a full-fledged package for cleaning contact information (phone numbers, addresses, etc.). Instead I decided to write a few functions of my own to get the job done.</description>
