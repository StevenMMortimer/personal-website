If you're a regular R user, then you've probably used or have seen the function 
`duplicated()`. If you've only grown up in the world of `dplyr` and other 
`tidyverse` packages with its cool function `distinct()`, then I highly envy you. In any 
case, you might find yourself using the `duplicated()` function when you need 
some more control. The function has a handy argument `incomparables` that allows 
you to ignore certain values when doing the comparison for duplicates. One day I 
wanted to use this to remove duplicate customer entries from our CRM system based 
on name and phone number. I went through the typical pre-processing stages of removing 
unnecessary punctionation, converting to lowercase, removing spaces, etc. 
After I got familiar with the data I realized that some of the data points were 
missing or not complete enough to make any meaningful determination of a duplicate. 
I needed a solution to ignore certain missing patterns, but it needed to encompass 
two or more columns of data. One hack would be to `paste0()` the columns together and 
work on a single pasted column, but this doesn't handle multiple incomparable values. 
As I found out, the duplicated function can handle multiple columns, but the 
`incomparables` argument does not work for multiple columns, let alone different 
incomparable values for each column. Here is the error I get:

```{r error=TRUE}
duplicated(mtcars[,c('am', 'gear', 'cyl')], incomparables=6)
```

This is really a bummer because it is nice to have this explicit functionality of 
what should really be considered when evaluating for duplicates. The error message 
sure is hopeful at the end there: "is not used (yet)"! After some digging I concluded that 
the function existed, as-is, at least since R version 1.4, which was released in 2001! 
I wouldn't hold my breath for anyone to actually fix this issue. Contributing 
changes to base R has become much for difficult. I submitted a patch to R core to fix 
this very issue, but they weren't too responsive. I guess it will stay as a hidden gem 
in base R, waiting for the next data miner to unearth. If you run across this issue 
and really want a fix, then feel free to use the code below. 
I've implemented a function to support incomparables across multiple columns where 
a list of vectors will specify the incomparable values for each column. The list 
elements are recycled if it is shorter than the columns being compared.

```{r}
new_duplicated <- function(x, incomparables = FALSE, fromLast = FALSE, ...) {
  
 if(!identical(incomparables, FALSE)) {
    n <- ncol(x)
    nmx <- names(x)
    nmincomparables <- names(incomparables)
    lincomparables <- length(incomparables)
    if(is.null(nmincomparables)) {
      if(lincomparables < n) {
        # pad any incomparables lists with the default value if list is shorter than the number columns in the supplied data.frame
        tmp <- c(incomparables, as.list(rep_len(FALSE, n - lincomparables)))
        names(tmp) <- nmx
        incomparables <- tmp 
      }
      if(lincomparables > n) {
        # if the list is unnamed and there are more elements in the list than there are columns, then only first n elements
        warning(paste("more columns in 'incomparables' than x, only using the first", n, "elements"))
        incomparables <- incomparables[1:n]
      }
    } else {
      # for named lists, find match, else default value
      tmp <- as.list(rep_len(FALSE, n))
      names(tmp) <- nmx
      i <- match(nmincomparables, nmx, 0L)
      if(any(i <= 0L))
        warning("not all columns named in 'incomparables' exist")
      tmp[ i[i > 0L] ] <- incomparables[i > 0L]
      incomparables <- tmp[nmx]
    }
    
    # first determine duplicates, then override when an incomparable value is found in a row since the existence of even 1 incomparable value in a row means it cannot be a duplicate
    res <- duplicated(do.call("paste", c(x, sep="\r")), fromLast = fromLast)
    
    #for better performance only bother with the columns that have incomparable values not set to the default: !identical(x, FALSE)
    run_incomp_check <- sapply(incomparables, FUN=function(x){!identical(x, FALSE)})
    if (sum(run_incomp_check) > 0L){
      incomp_check <- mapply(FUN=function(column,incomparables){match(column, incomparables)}, x[run_incomp_check], incomparables[run_incomp_check])
      # any rows with an incomparable match means, TRUE, it can override the duplicated result
      overwrite <- apply(data.frame(incomp_check), 1, function(x){any(!is.na(x))})
      res[overwrite] <- FALSE
    }
    
    return(res)
  } else if(length(x) != 1L) {
    duplicated(do.call("paste", c(x, sep="\r")), fromLast = fromLast)
  } else {
    duplicated(x[[1L]], fromLast = fromLast, ...)
  }
}
```

Here is the function in action: 

```{r}
mtcars2 <- head(mtcars[,c('am', 'gear', 'cyl')])
mtcars2$dup <- new_duplicated(mtcars2, incomparables=1)
mtcars2
```

Typically, the second row would be considered a duplicate of the first row, 
but since 1 is an incomparable value it is not considered a duplicate, in fact, 
any row containing a 1 in the column will be labeled as false since it renders the 
row incomparable.
